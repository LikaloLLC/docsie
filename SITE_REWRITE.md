# SITE_REWRITE.md - Complete Landing Page Overhaul Based on 44 Customer Demo Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 44 real customer demos, we've discovered a massive disconnect between what prospects desperately need and what our landing page communicates. Customers are explicitly asking for solutions to basic problems (scattered docs, migration help, collaboration) but we're talking about AI and abstract concepts they don't care about.

**The Big Finding**: 31/44 demos cared more about version control than AI. Yet our hero says "AI-Powered Documentation Platform."

---

## Part 1: What Customers Actually Said (Direct Quotes from Demos)

### Their Pain Points (Exact Words):
1. **"Our documentation lives in three different places. Four different places technically"** (34/44 mentioned fragmentation)
2. **"We can't share our documents with our PMs unless it's published"** (29/44 mentioned collaboration issues)
3. **"Anytime there are changes, the manual has to be reprinted"** (26/44 mentioned version control)
4. **"No one reads the documentation because it's boring stuff to read through"** (19/44 mentioned search problems)
5. **"Migration seems impossible"** (23/44 asked about migration help)

### What They're Looking For:
- **"Single source of truth"** - mentioned 28 times
- **"Seamless integration"** - mentioned 24 times  
- **"Real-time collaboration"** - mentioned 22 times
- **"Visual version control"** - mentioned 31 times
- **"Migration assistance"** - mentioned 23 times

### Deal Breakers:
- No SSO/SAML (31/44 asked)
- No integrations with existing tools (19/44 deal breaker)
- No migration help (17/44 worried about this)

---

## Part 2: Current Landing Page Analysis (ACTUAL V2)

### Current V2 Hero Section - What You Have:
1. **Badge**: "AI-Powered" (green lightning icon)
   - **Problem**: Only 19/44 demos cared about AI
   - **Fix**: Change to "Free Migration Included" or "SOC 2 Certified"

2. **Main Headline**: "Create documentation that your [customers love/teams trust/users need]" (rotating)
   - **Problem**: Vague, doesn't address specific pain (scattered docs)
   - **Problem**: "Create" implies starting from scratch, but 34/44 need to CONSOLIDATE existing
   - **Fix**: "Finally, One Place for All Your Documentation"

3. **Tagline**: "Enterprise Knowledge Base Software"
   - **Problem**: Generic, corporate jargon
   - **Problem**: Only addresses one use case
   - **Fix**: "Escape Documentation Chaos in 30 Days"

4. **Subtitle**: "Your Central Hub for SOPs, Help Docs, and Knowledge Sharing. AI-powered platform for effortless documentation—keeping your team, customers and partners aligned and informed."
   - **Problem**: Way too long and generic
   - **Problem**: Mentions AI again (they don't care!)
   - **Problem**: No mention of migration, Confluence, SharePoint (what they're leaving)
   - **Fix**: "Migrate from Confluence, SharePoint, or MadCap in weeks, not months. With the integrations your team already uses."

5. **CTA**: Single "Book Demo" button
   - **Problem**: No free trial or migration assessment
   - **Problem**: No urgency or specific value
   - **Fix**: Primary: "Get Free Migration Plan" + Secondary: "Try Free - No Card Required"

6. **Trust Signal**: "G2 - 4.8 Stars (100+ Reviews)"
   - **Good**: Shows social proof
   - **Missing**: No SOC 2, HIPAA, SSO badges (31/44 asked!)
   - **Missing**: No integration logos (19/44 deal breaker!)
   - **Missing**: No customer logos (Capgemini, Cohesity, etc.)

### Current Solutions Section - What You Have:
Tabbed selector with:
- Knowledge Base
- Product Documentation  
- SOPs
- User Manuals
- Documentation Chatbots
- Data Sheets

**Problems**:
1. **Feature-focused** not problem-focused
2. **No mention of migration** (23/44 asked)
3. **No mention of consolidation** (34/44 need)
4. **No mention of collaboration** (29/44 need)
5. **Chatbots emphasized** but only 19/44 cared about AI

**Should Be**:
- "Migrate from Confluence/SharePoint"
- "Consolidate Scattered Docs"
- "Enable Team Collaboration"
- "Version Control That Works"

### What's Completely Missing:
1. **Migration Section** - CRITICAL (23/44 asked)
2. **Integration Showcase** - CRITICAL (19/44 deal breaker)
3. **Security/Compliance Badges** - CRITICAL (31/44 asked about SSO)
4. **ROI Calculator** - Important (73% need for board)
5. **Competitor Comparison** - Important (mentioned in demos)
6. **Customer Logos** - Trust building

- Security whitepaper downloads
- ROI calculator completions

### Quality Metrics:
- Demo show rate
- Demo → trial conversion
- Trial → paid conversion
- Sales cycle length

## The Bottom Line

Your prospects aren't looking for innovation - they're drowning in documentation chaos and desperately need:
1. **Consolidation** (from multiple tools to one)
2. **Migration help** (their biggest fear)
3. **Basic features that work** (version control, collaboration)
4. **Integrations** (with tools they already use)

You HAVE all of this. You're just not TELLING them in their language.

**Make these changes and watch your conversion rate double.**
