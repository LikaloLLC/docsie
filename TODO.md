### Updated Landing Page Priorities

Based on 21 calls, the hero message should address these top concerns:
1. **Migration assistance** (62% of calls) - UNCHANGED, still #1
2. **Microsoft ecosystem integration** (38% of calls) 
3. **Support tool integrations** (24% of calls) - NEW PRIORITY
4. **Video-to-documentation** (14% of calls) - EMERGING NEED

Suggested new hero: "Migrate from Zendesk, MadCap Flare, or Confluence to Modern Documentation"
Subtext: "Works with Teams, Intercom & Zoho â€¢ AI converts videos to docs â€¢ On-premise available"

### ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation

After analyzing 21 demo calls, the patterns are clear and consistent:
- **Primary pain point**: Migration from inadequate tools (62%)
- **Key integrations**: Microsoft Teams, Intercom, Zoho Desk
- **Emerging need**: Video-to-documentation conversion

We have sufficient data to begin implementation of landing page changes and supplementary pages.
