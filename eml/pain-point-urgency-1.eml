Subject: Stop answering the same procedure questions 15 times a day

Hi [Name],

Does this sound familiar?

Your team watches a safety video during onboarding, then calls you three weeks later asking "How do I do X again?" 

You explain the same procedure. Again. While thinking "Didn't we just train you on this?"

**Here's what we're seeing with companies like yours:**

Instead of supervisors being interrupted 15+ times per shift with basic questions, their workers now get instant, spoken answers from an AI assistant trained on their actual procedures.

**Pilot offer (no catch):**
We'll prove this works by converting your training content into working AI assistants. You test it for 2 weeks with your team. If it doesn't save your supervisors significant time, you owe us nothing.

We typically see 60%+ reduction in basic questions within week 1.

Worth 10 minutes to see this in action?
