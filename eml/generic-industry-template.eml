Hi [Name],

Your team has valuable knowledge locked in training videos that rarely get watched twice.

We help companies transform their existing video content into AI-powered documentation that actually gets used.

Here's what forward-thinking companies are doing with our platform:
• Converting training videos into searchable, interactive guides
• Creating AI avatars that explain procedures 24/7
• Reducing repetitive questions by up to 70%
• Supporting global teams with multilingual documentation

**14-day pilot program for [Company]:**
We'll take up to 25 of your videos and transform them into intelligent documentation, plus create an AI avatar demo of your most critical procedure.

All at no cost during the pilot period.

The result? Your team gets instant answers instead of rewatching hour-long videos.

Interested? Simply reply "YES" and I'll share the details.

Best,
Philippe
CEO, Docsie

P.S. We typically see 50-70% reduction in support questions within the first month.
