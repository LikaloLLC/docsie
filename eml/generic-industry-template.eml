Subject: Your training videos sit unwatched (here's why)

Hi [Name],

Quick reality check: When was the last time someone watched your safety training videos twice?

Most operations teams create training content that gets watched once during onboarding, then never touched again. Meanwhile, supervisors get interrupted 10-15 times per shift with the same basic questions.

We help companies solve this by transforming existing training videos into AI assistants that actually engage with workers.

**Free pilot for [Company]:**
We'll convert up to 25 of your training videos into AI-powered documentation and create a working AI avatar that can explain your most critical procedure.

Companies using our platform see:
- 70% reduction in repetitive questions to supervisors
- Workers getting instant answers in their preferred language  
- Critical procedures actually being followed consistently
- Faster onboarding for new hires and contractors

This pilot is completely free - you keep everything regardless of what happens next.

Worth 15 minutes to see how this works? Reply "PILOT" and I'll send details.

Best,
Svit from Docsie
