Subject: Your procedures are perfect. Your workers aren't following them.

Hi [Name],

You've spent months creating detailed safety procedures. Clear step-by-step instructions. Everything documented perfectly.

So why are you still seeing the same mistakes? Why do workers still cut corners or "forget" critical steps?

**The problem isn't your procedures. It's how workers access them.**

When someone needs to check a procedure mid-task, they're not going to:
- Stop what they're doing
- Find the right manual
- Scroll through 40 pages
- Find the relevant section

They'll wing it. Or ask you. Again.

**What if your procedures could talk back?**

Instead of static documents, imagine workers asking "How do I handle X?" and getting instant, spoken step-by-step guidance.

We're proving this works with select companies this quarter. 

Your procedures become AI assistants. Workers get answers instantly. You stop being the walking procedure manual.

**Test it risk-free:** https://www.docsie.io/solutions/ai/ai-pilot/
