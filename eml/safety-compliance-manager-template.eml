Hi [Name],

Your safety procedures are critical, but workers still don't follow them correctly, and auditors keep finding gaps.

We help companies in renewable energy, logistics, and professional services deploy AI documentation that ensures compliance procedures are actually followed.

Organizations similar to yours use our platform to:
✅ Guide workers through complex safety procedures step-by-step
✅ Provide instant answers to compliance questions
✅ Create audit trails of procedure completion
✅ Support multilingual teams with consistent training

**No-risk pilot for [Company]:**
We'll transform 25 of your safety/compliance videos into intelligent documentation and create an AI avatar demo of your most critical procedure.

This gives you confidence during audits and reduces safety incidents.

Worth 15 minutes to see this in action? Reply "DEMO" and we'll set it up.

Best,
Philippe
CEO, Docsie
Deployed across energy, shipping, and consulting operations

P.S. Our pilot includes up to 3 languages - perfect for diverse workforce compliance.
