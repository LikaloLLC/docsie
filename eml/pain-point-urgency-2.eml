Subject: Stop answering the same procedure questions 15 times a day

Hi [Name],

Every day, your supervisors answer the same questions your training already covered.

Workers watch training videos once (if at all), then interrupt supervisors 10-15 times per shift with basic questions about procedures they should already know.

**Here's what we're seeing with companies that qualify for our pilot:**

Instead of supervisors being the walking procedure manual, workers now get instant answers from AI assistants trained on their actual procedures.

**Free 14-day pilot for [Company]:**
- Convert up to 25 of your training videos into AI-powered documentation
- Create a custom AI demo of your most critical procedure  
- Full team training session and analytics
- Keep everything regardless of what happens next

We prioritize companies with 100+ employees, existing training videos, safety/compliance requirements, and multilingual teams.

Results from recent pilots:
- "60% reduction in supervisor interruptions within the first week" — Operations Director
- "Workers actually engage now" — Safety Director  
- "Spanish-speaking workers finally get answers in their language" — Training Manager
