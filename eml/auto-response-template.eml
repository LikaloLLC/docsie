Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in our AI documentation pilot!

I'll personally reach out within 24 hours to schedule your free demonstration.

In the meantime, here's what we'll cover:
• How to transform your existing training videos into AI assistants
• Live demo of an AI avatar explaining procedures
• Your specific use case and expected ROI
• Details of the 14-day free pilot program

To help me prepare for our conversation, could you quickly share:
1. How many training/procedure videos does your team currently have?
2. What's your biggest documentation challenge right now?

You can also book a time directly here: https://calendly.com/docsie-io/docsie-io-ai-pilot/

Looking forward to showing you how AI can transform your documentation!

Best,
Philippe
CEO, Docsie

P.S. Our pilot includes converting up to 25 videos and creating a custom AI avatar demo - completely free for qualified companies.
