Hi [Name],

Quick reality check: When was the last time someone watched your safety training videos twice?

We work with companies like those in renewable energy, shipping, and consulting to solve this exact problem by transforming existing training videos into AI assistants that actually engage with workers.

Companies similar to yours are already using our platform to:
- Convert training videos into interactive, searchable guides
- Create AI avatars that explain critical procedures
- Deploy multilingual training for diverse teams

**Pilot program for [Company]:**
We'll convert 25 of your training videos into AI-powered documentation and create a working avatar demo of your most important procedure.

This eliminates the training engagement problem that costs companies thousands in repeated questions and safety incidents.

Interested in seeing how this works? Just reply "SHOW ME."

Best,
Philippe
CEO, Docsie
Trusted by leaders in energy, shipping, and consulting

P.S. This pilot is completely free for qualified companies - no credit card required.
