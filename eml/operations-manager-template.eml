Hi [Name],

How much time do your supervisors waste explaining the same procedures over and over?

We work with operations teams in energy, logistics, and consulting who faced this exact challenge. They solved it by turning existing operational videos into AI assistants that provide instant answers.

Companies in your industry now use our platform to:
- Eliminate repetitive questions to supervisors
- Onboard new contractors and employees faster  
- Ensure consistent procedure execution across sites
- Support multilingual operations teams

**Free pilot for [Company]:**
We'll convert 25 of your operational videos into AI-powered guides and create an avatar that can explain your most important procedure instantly.

This typically saves operations managers 10+ hours per week in interruptions.

Ready to give your supervisors their time back? Reply "PILOT" for details.

Best,
Philippe
CEO, Docsie
Powering efficient operations across energy, shipping, and consulting

P.S. Setup takes just 48 hours - you'll see results in week one.
