In order to understand how to create a product one-pager that people will really read, it's vital to first understand what it is intended to do. The product one-pager is a stage that occurs between the conception of an idea and the creation of full project blueprints. Despite its briefness, it is far from being a scribbled-on-the-paper thinking experiment. It is a well-researched document that sets the tone for a product or important feature early in the product's lifetime by establishing expectations.

One-page product descriptions that are captivating may help to develop support and momentum for the campaign. It may serve as a reference point even after the focus has switched to development, user experience, and quality assurance. It may also put a stop to a fresh endeavor.

So, what is it about a one-pager that makes it so special? Let's start with a discussion of why you would need one of them in the first place.

## Three Arguments for Writing a Product One-Pager

Why has this specific analog relic remained relevant and valuable in an age where so many papers have been replaced by collaborative digital means for communication, as opposed to earlier generations?

The task of establishing a shared understanding of fundamental facts and ideas has gotten increasingly difficult in recent years. A well-constructed product one-pager documentation may bridge gaps and develop support by setting the stage for stakeholders and providing them with information.

This one-pager can be totally digitally created and formatted in order to email to others and even converted into a PDF with Docsie, but why is this one-pager so important for product managers?

### 1. Raise awareness and support for a certain issue.

A product one-pager argues for the importance of a new initiative and why the company should support it. It highlights the fundamental goals of the projects and discusses how their success will benefit the company as a whole if they are successful.

To inspire confidence in the decision-maker, it gives information regarding the opportunity and competitive situation. By putting out the essentials, there is enough knowledge and mutual comprehension to go ahead in a productive manner.

### 2. Define the scope of the project.

Many stakeholders are apprehensive about embarking on a new endeavor without fully understanding what it involves. A one-pager outlines what is included in the initiatives, as well as what is not included, which is critical information.

Decision-makers get more confidence in what they're supporting when these important aspects are clearly articulated. It serves as a constant reference point throughout the project's lifespan, defining criteria for what should be included and excluded.

### 3. Specify what constitutes success.

A product one-pager outlines the "why" of a specific effort and what the company should anticipate as a consequence of the initiative from the outset of the process.

As at this point, there are no specific measurements or milestones to work towards. There should be sufficient clarity to allow the implementation team to determine whether or not they are on the correct track. In addition, stakeholders utilize the one-pager to keep up with the progress of the application.

## Key Characteristics of a Product One-Pager that Stand Out from the Competition

That which distinguishes a fantastic one-pager from another is its design. Here are five things to bear in mind while writing one of these critical product briefings for your company's product. These are essential to know.

### Conciseness

By definition, a one-pager is already very condensed and concise. These are masterclasses in succinctness, and they stand out as motivators for stakeholders. In certain cases, even a single page of paper might seem like an uphill battle to get through because it is too thick and overloaded with information.

Executives are juggling a lot of responsibilities. They want information that is presented in bite-sized, value-packed bits so that they can analyze, make a choice, and then go on with their lives.

Please be considerate of their time. Keep in mind that your project is only one of several ideas that they are considering.

### Make certain that all of the bases are covered.

Despite the fact that it must be concise and to the point, your product one-pager documentation must not have any obvious flaws or key unsolved loopholes. It should always have the following components:

### Goal

What is the motivation behind your proposal? What is it that you aim to accomplish? It should be noted that this is distinct from product or business objectives and is particular to the "why" of this project.

### What is the definition of success?

What are the conditions that must be met in order for this venture to be considered a success if we achieve this (and do it well)?

* **Backstory: **This should include answers to some supporting "why" questions, such as why there is a need or opportunity, why now is the best moment to begin, and why your company/product is well-positioned to be successful.

* **Items that are a 'must-have': **While this should not be a comprehensive list of requirements, it should include those that are absolutely necessary in version 1.0 in order for this effort to fulfill the aim and meet the success criteria previously established. This will also assist stakeholders in gaining a better understanding of the magnitude of the project's potential scope.

* **Items that are not covered under the scope of the project: **While this does not have to be a thorough list, it is here that you may express the needs for this phase of the project (or at all). Limit this to criteria that are connected to the scope and that stakeholders could expect to be included. For example, being able to import data or supporting a certain platform are both desirable. It should draw attention to locations where scope creep might become a problem in the future.

* **Competition: **What steps are being taken to resolve this issue now? What strategies are existing rivals doing to cope with this problem? What obstacles must be overcome in order to get a sufficient proportion of the market? Are there any other technologies or techniques that others have thought about or attempted in the past? What is the current market share of your company? Providing answers to these questions demonstrate that you have done your study and helps to define the terrain.

* **Timing factors that are critical: **While it is early to develop a project plan or timetable for this new venture, there may be a critical reason to complete it by a certain date. A major industry event, a contractual deadline for a client, a seasonal window of opportunity, or even the necessity to replace a failing internal system are just a few examples. Stakeholders must be informed if there is a sense of urgency or if there are any specific time limits to bear in mind.



All of this information can be filled out and done on [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/). By doing this you can export your files into a PDF format, or email the documentation with our online cloud link. It all can be password protected so that outsiders won't be able to access this information who are outside this project.

### The emphasis is on the impact.

**Due to the fact that product one-pagers are not product specifications, you do not need to provide a long list of needs.** The goal here is to get support for the effort as far as possible. It is more important to understand why this is a good thing for the company as opposed to how it will operate or what it would look like.

Maintain your emphasis on strategy alignment and how a successful implementation may impact the key metrics that matter to the company's performance. If there is no overlap with the organization's areas of emphasis, it is hard to justify the expenditure of the necessary resources.

It may also provide insight into what the business stands to lose if they do not proceed with the project. For example, falling behind rivals, losing critical clients, or being hamstrung by technological debt are all possible outcomes of not partaking in a particular opportunity the product holds. There's nothing worse than realizing too late that you've lost out on a giant opportunity and there's nothing you can do to make it right. 

### Well research cases

The product one-pager, on the other hand, does not provide much space for explanation. Every assertion, assumption, and forecast is based on facts and data that can be verified. If this supporting information is not included in the one-pager, the hypotheses and outcomes addressed will still be based on reasonable assumptions. They should be able to withstand any obstacles that may arise in the future.

Equally crucial, the project suggested in the product one-pager must have realistic and sensible expectations for its objectives. Product team members should be able to stand by the outcomes of the project from the beginning to the end of its lifecycle. Those objectives may not be as high or as wide as the previous ones. Setting expectations, on the other hand, will yield benefits in terms of both the project's success and your personal credibility.

### The Art of Storytelling

A complicated tale cannot be told on a single page because of the limited space available. A one-pager that is intriguing must communicate an inspirational narrative. They all follow a similar plotline, albeit the nuances and details might differ greatly.

In a nutshell, you establish the scene by stating the existing condition of affairs. Following that, you do consumer research to establish a market demand. Following that, you should provide a short summary of the recommended solution or technique to fulfill this requirement.

Then you explain why this solution will meet the need and how it fits into the wider competitive environment. Finish your story by describing the ramifications of a successful implementation and deployment in terms of effect. The organization has placed a high priority on promoting the product or business strategy, as well as on influencing any key performance indicators or other measures. However, these bite-sized business cases do serve to establish the tone for the project's future.
