![Bloomfire](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_mkOf2MlxBmZj1RvBj/boo_Iebiil2U1sriACOKe/0319c9ee-884b-9b49-d449-d0e0b197d5e0image.png)

Bloomfire flattens information hierarchies and ensures that all employees, regardless of their department or job, have access to the same knowledge. This enables you to break through organizational silos and better align your teams.

It is not uncommon for knowledge bases to give access to both internal and external sources of information. Bloomfire may be a great choice for organizations looking to exchange research or thought-provoking content in order to produce manuals, user guides, or product documentation. However, some users think that Bloomfire's scalability is limited, owing in part to the lack of connections.

Users may upload information in any format, including word documents, PDFs, videos, audio recordings, and slide presentations, or create new content directly on the site. Bloomfire thoroughly indexes each word in each file, ensuring that users can quickly discover the information they're looking for. Bloomfire data encryption, safe hosting, and numerous backup sites are all included in the security features. To enhance interaction, Bloomfire has features for producing newsletters and custom lists. Employees and consumers also benefit from AI-driven searches with recommended content.

Additionally, you may use their bulk importing and exporting tool to keep your wiki's pages current and archive any obsolete or unnecessary documents.
