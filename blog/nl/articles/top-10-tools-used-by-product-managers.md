This article will assist you in comparing and evaluating the finest product management platforms and tools in a timely manner. First, I'll go over a list of tools, and then I'll go over the many sorts of PM tools you may use while developing your products.

### What Are Product Management Tools, How Do They Work and Why Do Product Managers Need Them?

Product management teams have a borage of life cycle processes which can be complex and cause many stages to complete them. These stages require product managers to use various applications to speed up certain processes. Product management tools are software applications that assist product teams with any or all aspects of the product lifecycle, including planning, researching, and creating, as well as releasing, assessing, and iterating on a product.** **Product managers also need tools for establishing a product roadmaping, user journey mapping, consumer research, feature prioritization, managing sprints, prototyping, evaluating product data, process mapping, and managing product releases are all tasks that product teams utilize product management tools for.

Remote product management teams who require a central location to create and manage their products may benefit from product management solutions. Powerful tools such as Docsie and Monday.com are essential to help speed up the process and allow for a smooth workflow.

### What type of product management software is necessary for a successful product management team?

Software that is meant to assist you in improving and maintaining a part of your organization must include specific characteristics. Because it's difficult to find a product management software with all of these capabilities, we believe it's important to include a various tools that are useful when managing your product. Let's have a look at some of the most important tools for product managers.

* **Product documentation: **In order to prepare your product for release, you'll need to create product documentation. Customers can use these papers to learn how to use the product and handle any issues. Every sort of product requires documentation, however, the degree of depth and types of documentation vary.

* **Data management/sharing**: In order to have effective coordination between yourself and your team members, you'll need a tool like this. A prerequisite for a simple product management cycle is the ability to communicate and interact with readily available data.

* **User tracking/analysis**: Getting a good read on your user base and how they react to your product is critical to keeping your  product running at its best for the longest period.

* **Customer survey tools: **There is no better method to optimize your products than consumers than to simply ask them how they feel about your product, other than watching user behavior**.**

* **Roadmapping**: The ability to use a road mapping tool within your chosen product management software will be quite helpful in ensuring that your product runs smoothly.

* **Prototyping**: To get off to a good start, you need to have the appropriate vision for your product from the beginning.

* **Task management:** Assigning the appropriate job to the right team member provides the best possible execution of that task, and the ability to monitor that performance in real-time is an extra benefit that many product managers enjoy.

**Capterra Rating: **3.8/5

### 7. Productboard

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vmUktnidPAUGYqJl7/boo_MNiBMszeecwIAY9Z9/843532c2-096c-2cfb-7ed9-a7143b1c6bd8image.png)

* Email Support, FAQs/Forum, [Knowledge Base](https://support.productboard.com/hc/en-us), Online Chat

* Productboard provides its users with a 15-day free trial and charges $49 per user each month.

Productboard is a product management solution that assists your team in determining what features your target consumers want, prioritizing which features to create (and when), and bringing everyone from planning to QA together around your product roadmap.

The depth and breadth of third-party connection possibilities with major project management software were one of the things I looked for in this study. While Productboard provides a number of connectivity possibilities, it has fewer connections than the majority of the companies on our list.

Productboard excels in many things, but one feature that stands out is the ability to aggregate product data and client requirements/requests across several inboxes, including Slack.

**Capterra Rating:** 4.7/5

### 8. ProductPlan

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_WYpc1dHsUZTZOLBc4/boo_MNiBMszeecwIAY9Z9/98bdb930-af32-2fa3-532b-6ee370e3daa9image.png)

**Pricing:** 

* ProductPlan provides a 14-day free trial and it costs $39 per user each month.

ProductPlan offers over 25 different roadmap templates to choose from. Despite the impressive list of capabilities above, ProductPlan lacks an appropriate mechanism to manage requirements for the products it hosts. This won't be an issue for many users because needs are frequently handled independently; nonetheless, it's something to keep in mind.

ProductPlan also includes templates for product roadmaps as well as launch plans, executive projects, IT plans, and more.

**Capterra Rating: **4.5/5

### 9. Roadmunk

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_swOpuXkyNZdkfxmWA/boo_MNiBMszeecwIAY9Z9/69f2283c-947d-4b67-43d9-4c4cd664902fimage.png)

**Support:**

**Pricing:** 

* Roadmunk is available for $19 per month with a 14-day free trial.

Capturing consumer feedback, prioritizing what to create, and designing boardroom-ready strategy roadmaps will be important to product managers.

Because of its relevance for the development cycle, I particularly call out customer feedback aggregation as a product management tool attribute in the assessment criteria. Roadmunk understands this better than most, and their ability to manage all user requests in one centralized location (their "feedback mailbox") received high marks.

**Capterra Rating:** 4.4/5

### 10. Wrike

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_RybC6Vo8HnKJY4dhb/boo_MNiBMszeecwIAY9Z9/99d4a719-0e24-6062-5d25-6e2d2f5e38feimage.png)

**Price:**

Wrike, which is used by Google and Hootsuite, is a collaborative product management platform with a feature set that complements the work style of any product development team. Wrike can help you manage your product lifecycle whether you use a classic waterfall method or an agile framework.

There are many integrations available with Wrike but it does lack a few feature sets that might be useful for product management, such as configurable concept and planning templates.
