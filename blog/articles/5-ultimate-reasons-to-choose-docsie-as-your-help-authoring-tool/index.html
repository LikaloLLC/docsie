      <p>Suppose you are the administrator of a customer service support solution. Now, you have an expert team but all their efforts are being thwarted due to the lack of comprehensive enterprise software. It's definitely not an easy task, but you first need to get clarity on what your goals are to provide superior content experiences to your teams and clients.  </p>
<p><strong>What do you need help with? Designing? Publishing? Maintaining your documentation?</strong></p>
<p>Shed all your worries and introduce HAT to your team members! Use a HAT and get ready to fine-tune your content with powerful features that improve collaboration between teams and create the most effective technological documents. It also simplifies technical content in such a way that most teams prefer them over tools like MS Word documents or simple HTML. </p>
<p>With the help of <strong>Help Authoring Tools,</strong> companies can effortlessly produce and maintain documentation with detailed description and that too, for diverse platforms such as <strong>PDFs, eBooks, mobile, web, printed documents, etc. </strong>It helps in eliminating the use of platforms like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.</p>
<p>This article takes you on a quick journey of what a HAT (Help Authoring Tool) is all about and how Docsie has started sounding synonymous with being a HAT. </p>
<h2>What is a HAT (Help Authoring Tool)?</h2>
<p>The Help Authoring Tools are the permanent companions for technical writers. This software program helps authors design, write, edit and publish their documentation digitally. Authors can also accumulate the software help documentation and convert them into a single source database using it in various formats, including <strong>PDFs, HTML, XML</strong>, etc. They are much more than simple word processors as they sometimes also have a built-in image tool that can save hours. It's indeed a life saver for small businesses. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular HATs are <strong>Docsie, MadCap Flare, Adobe RoboHelp, Author-it, Doc-To-Help, and HelpNDoc</strong>, among others. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_f6SovysLWKtxbWYZY/image3.png" /></p>
<h2>Five Key features of HAT To Produce High-Quality Documentation:</h2>
<h3>1. Finding errors:</h3>
<p>In the case of HATs, code editing and text editing are the principal features. HATs eliminate errors and break down the complex writing process into simple steps. They offer grammar suggestions and create templates which companies can work on to create customised content. Most HATs also provide step-by-step instructions so that teams can learn and get familiar with them to create great products. </p>
<p>By developing automated language style guides with the help of HATs, companies can develop their brand language. When it comes to code editing, front-end web developers often use such tools. HATs also help brands in maintaining their documentation tone, format and appearance intact. </p>
<h3>2. Content Management (End-to-End):</h3>
<p>A lot of the Help Authoring Tools available in the industry today share a set of similarities with content management systems (CMS). Shadowing the main function of CMS tools and platforms, HATs assist technical writers in managing their content projects, storing and tracking their progression. </p>
<p>The point where a HAT differs from a CMS is that a HAT has every content project linked to a particular set of files, helps, manuals and software explanation guides. While using a HAT, you can prevent data loss and also restore the last saved version of your documents. This is a super benefit of a HAT that lets you access valuable information even after facing an unpredictable technical glitch. Moreover, they provide single sign-on support to ensure things run smoothly. </p>
<p>Most of the HAT platforms provide topic-based authoring, wherein you can break down the documentation into smaller, byte-sized pieces that can be easily grasped by your clients. </p>
<h3>3. File Transactions:</h3>
<p>When you use HATs, you can easily import and export your files, ensuring seamless file transactions between multiple platforms. The good part is that you do not need to do convert each of your file manually. Through HATs, you can effortlessly work on the same file content and create multiple formats of the same document. </p>
<p>Once you have multiple formats, <strong>what happens to your original document?</strong> Fear not, for the automatic conversion feature of the HATs lets you preserve the original documentation, keeping the structure and format intact. This decreases the possibility of errors, reducing time and effort. This feature becomes even more significant when content authors need to share their project files with other contributors. </p>
<h3>4. Improve Content:</h3>
<p>When it comes to content creation, nothing can beat the importance of brainstorming to churn out fresh ideas. Software solutions such as HATs streamline communication between teams, making remote working easier and ensuring constant collaboration between team members. There are other remarkable features like real-time editing, commenting and version control. Through these features, you can reduce miscommunication amongst your team members, increase productivity and reduce time and effort considerably. </p>
<p>HATs are great tools that keep team members well-knitted in a close group. One of the noteworthy features of HATs includes track changes. This lets users switch between various versions of the same document, creating comprehensive and well-documented content irrespective of what topic you're working on.  </p>
<p>Moreover, you can use elements like videos, animations, and interactive simulations to improve the learning experience for you teams or customers by using HAT tools. </p>
<h3>5. Publishing and Maintenance:</h3>
<p>Updating and maintaining documentation regularly is a tiring process. To ease things for its users, a HAT lets writers make changes to the preliminary source file following which updates are made to all the file formats. This ensures that all users remain up to date regarding the changes that are made and can access the final version of the file without any hassle. </p>
<p>In the case of publishing, HATs often provide templates so that technical authors can work on the already existing base-level formatting. The templates also suggest various kinds of visual layouts, making it easier for technical writers to pull videos, motion graphics, videos, etc. from other sources. </p>
