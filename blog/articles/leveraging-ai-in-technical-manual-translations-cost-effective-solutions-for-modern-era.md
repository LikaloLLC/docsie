Did you know that today, [65 percent ](https://csa-research.com/Blogs-Events/CSA-in-the-Media/Press-Releases/Consumers-Prefer-their-Own-Language)of customers prefer content in their native language? And 40 percent of customers would not order a product from a website in a language other than their own. As businesses expand into new regions, it is more important than ever that their technical manuals be translated into several languages so that they can explain their services to users in a better way to cater to a global audience. 

Eliminating language barriers improves non-native buyers journey and customer satisfaction on a web platform, improving global reach. However, in the past, this took time and effort to do. Thankfully, a game-changing answer in the form of AI translations has appeared. Because of this breakthrough, translation focused on the target audience is now easier, quicker, and cheaper than ever before, as businesses do not need need to guzzle cash for hiring native speakers or linguists.

## Conventional Methods of Analysis

Previously, all manual translation work had to be done by human translators who had to deal with a long set of instructions with their linguistic skills and common standards. However, there were difficulties with the technical jargon. Consider how hard it is to express complex ideas to someone who needs to learn about the topic. As mistakes were fixed and precision was maintained, this usually led to longer wait times and higher costs.

### What Does the Rise of AI will Mean for the Translation Industry?

According to a study, the AI translation market, by 2030 is projected to be worth[ $7.5 billion](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/machine-translation-market-size), as businesses try to expand their horizons by tapping global markets and international customers. This growth directly results from the rising demand for AI-driven translation tools that are helping customers around the world. 

The field of translation is already seeing the effects of artificial intelligence. Imagine a day when computers are so advanced that they can instantly convert text between any two languages they know. With the help of AI, this can now be done without any human intervention. This simplifies operations and ensures a cost-effective localisation process. Businesses no longer need as many in-house human translators as they formerly did and they can generate content in as many languages as they want without any technical education. This change may help keep expenses and increase output, making organizations more globally competitive.

There are several approaches that AI translation tools can use to translate text.

 **Machine learning**

[Training Machine Learning algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/much-training-data-required-machine-learning/) require massive amounts of data and code. This anthology has several parallel writings, which are pairs of phrases or paragraphs written in two languages but with the same meaning. Effective translation algorithms trained on the matched texts may employ the patterns they have learned to create their high-quality translations.

**Statistical methods**

AI translation tools use several different statistical methods. In these processes, we use statistical analysis to determine the most likely translation of a given word or phrase. We understand the requirements of the clients before deploying the translation process.

 **Neural networks**

Machine learning algorithms called neural networks aim to mimic the operation of the human brain. Neural networks have promise for the transfer of complex information.

### How Can AI Be Used to Improve Technical Manual Translations?

AI translation tools may be trained on large parallel text datasets comprising pairings of terms in several languages with the same meaning. This might be useful for identifying and translating jargon and terminology. As a result, jargon and terminology may be translated using the tools. AI tools might use this to learn how to translate technical words properly. For instance, [Google ](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[Translate](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[ ](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html) NMT model was trained using a massive original and translated source code database. That implies that Google Translate can easily understand medical, legal, and engineering jargon.

AI translation tools may be trained to recognize the context of all things text. This allows them to convey the meaning of statements with several interpretations more effectively. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator), for example is an SMT tool that has been trained on a massive corpus of source code and translated texts. With this improvement, DeepL is better able to deal with sentences that might be translated in several ways based on the context of the text it is translating.

Tools driven by artificial intelligence might be trained to translate sentences in a natural tone. This is particularly important for technical manuals, which often use specialized terminology that might be difficult to translate. [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/)[ ](https://www.docsie.io/)is a hybrid solution to the translation issue since it draws from both statistical machine translation and neural machine translation.

## Use of AI in Technical Manual Translations - Benefits and Limitations

Let us discuss the [constraints artificial intelligence faces](https://translatebyhumans.com/blog/risks-and-consequences-of-ai-translation-in-2023/) while attempting to translate how-to guides. While AI has made great strides in recent years, there are still certain important constraints to keep in mind.

**1. Human judgment:** When it comes to choosing the right words and phrases, AI is not always as good as humans. For example, **"set"** might be mistakenly rendered as "**juego**" in Spanish. The appropriate term is **"conjunto."**

**2. Bias:**  The training data is crucial to the final product's quality. AI may develop a taste for that nation's culture and language if it is fed just books from that country.

**3. Security:**  There is a fear that putting sensitive information via an AI translator might compromise security. It is dangerous because private data might get into the wrong hands.

**4. Lack of cultural context:** AI may struggle to understand the cultural importance of a text, leading to inaccurate results. For example, if it translates "to pull someone's leg" (from English) to "to pull someone's hair" (from Spanish), that would make no sense in either the English or Spanish cultural contexts.

**5. Potential Idiomatic Challenges:** It is simple for artificial intelligence to translate words but may grapple with sentences whose meanings vary between languages. Idioms are idiomatic terms that can be challenging to comprehend literally due to their cultural connotations.


Using a hybrid system that combines [machine learning with human translators](https://hbr.org/2018/07/collaborative-intelligence-humans-and-ai-are-joining-forces) is one way to overcome AI's shortcomings when translating technical manuals. Human reviewers could catch and correct any mistakes made by AI translations, which could then handle the majority of the job. Technical manuals may be translated more precisely and consistently using this integrated method without losing subtlety in the target language or cultural context.

The methods of translation can be both time consuming and expensive. They often involve hiring translators, which can significantly impact your budget. Moreover, these translators might not possess industry knowledge. It may inadvertently introduce errors during the translation process.

By automating the translation process, [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/)[ ](https://www.docsie.io/)offers businesses an opportunity to reduce their translation costs. Making use of machine learning capabilities, Docsie ensures efficient translations, thereby saving businesses time and money.
