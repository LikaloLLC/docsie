It offers a free program with basic functionality, making it accessible to small groups and beginners.\n    \n-   It offers pricing policies for groups of varying sizes and needs, from small groups to large enterprises.\n    \n-   Provides advanced features and functions for the business.\n    \n-   Dedicated support is available for Enterprise customers.\n    \n-   Allow on-premise or private cloud hosting for added security and control.\n    \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-   The limitations of an open system, such as large numbers of users, can restrict scalability for growing teams.\n    \n-   Some advanced features are only available in more expensive programs and may give way to smaller, budget-constrained organisations.\n    \n\n### \n\nArchbee:\n\nStrengths:\n\n-   It offers a free plan with basic functionality, allowing small groups to get started at no cost.\n    \n-   Offers pricing plans for groups of all sizes, and all plans include unlimited spaces and vouchers.\n    \n-   Team and Business settings allow customisation and branding of domains.\n    \n-   SAML integration adds security authentication.\n    \n-   It provides a public API for integration with other tools and systems.\n    \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-   The free plan is limited to three members and may not be enough for larger groups or organisations.\n    \n-   Some advanced features, such as SAML integration and API access, are only available on the more expensive systems.\n    \n-   Customisation options for branding and domains are limited to the Team and Business settings.\n    \n\n### \n\nDocise:\n\nStrengths:\n\n-   It offers a free public and private knowledge program suitable for small businesses or private use.\n    \n-   It offers a variety of pricing policies, including scaling policies, catering to groups of varying sizes and needs.\n    \n-   It comes with a wide range of features such as custom domains, knowledge embedding websites, and importing from different formats.\n    \n-   It provides options for protecting documents with passwords and the use of Google Analytics.\n    \n-   It also supports automatic translations and AI-powered \"ghost translations\" for multilingual documents.\n    \n\nWeakness:\n\n-   Free systems are the only public and private knowledge, which can be limiting for large or multiple projects.\n    \n-   Some advanced features, such as importing Word or HTML, and accessing the Docsie API, are only available on more expensive systems.\n    \n-   Some features, such as on-premise or private cloud hosting and document export customisation, require an Enterprise configuration.\n    \n-   Dedicated support is for Enterprise customers only.\n    \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these strengths and weaknesses are based on the pricing structure and may not include all of the features and limitations of each platform.
