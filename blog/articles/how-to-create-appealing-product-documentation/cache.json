If you wonder why this is, the answer is simple. It is due to the fact that technical communication skills are crucial to collect information and enable the audience to comprehend the product or technology more effectively.\n\nWhile communication in the actual world is made by speech, body language and emotion expressions, in the virtual world technical communication takes place through technical product documentation!\n\nThe only aim of technical product documentation is to facilitate the user's understanding of the working dynamics and architecture of a product and technology. It's more like a \"how to use\" handbook for your new workers, users/customers and anybody else who has to be aware of the working methods, a thorough description of the nut and bolts of a product!\n\nIt is the product managers duty to take upon himself/herself the responsibility of developing a team to create, manage, publish and maintain polished product documentation.\n\nI am sure every product manager has said or has heard the following in their department: \"Product documentation is a component of the Product Owner's obligations\"; \"Each development team should document their own apps\"; \"the feature has been deployed, has the manual been updated?\" or, much worse, \"there is an error in the technical documentation.\"\n\nClearly, technical product documentation might be a bit puzzling as straightforward as it seems! While individuals attempt to solve or argue about the lines in the preceding paragraph, manuals and tutorials deteriorate, which is detrimental to your \"product/company\" image.\n\nTo assist anyone experiencing similar issues, here are some procedures to implement to optimize your product documentation.\n\n## What is the purpose of product documentation?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AkCWDsRGayFUwrjU6/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/1945711f-8493-b2f6-a461-26ddae0b04acidea_3310390_1920.jpg)\n\nWhen you're talking about product documentation for a technological product or service, you're talking about the information that describes it and the data that pertains to it.\n\nTechnical documentation, or product documentation, is all about helping your audience and customers utilize, read, understand, and utilize your product. Most product documentations, of course, are produced in diverse areas including engineering, medical, information technology, and marketing.\n\nThe great technical product documentation helps your audience navigate your product and enable them to utilize it without complications.\n\nOne other consideration is that technical documentation is critical for customer assistance and contributes significantly to your company's branding and confidence. When they're most in need, users search for technical documentation. The audience uses your product to learn about the processes and deal with issues.\n\nThis means having thorough and comprehensive product documentation which is dynamic with search capabilities is very important\n\n\n\n## What are the different product documentation\n\nThis section allows you to see what kind of product documentation you need for your customers or clients.\n\nThere are many different product documentation types that meet the need of different types of use cases and user needs:\n\n**Product User documentation:** This consists of user manuals, how-to guides, tutorials, FAQs, release notes, and training manuals, as well as operating procedures.\n\n**Corporate documentation:** [Surveys show ](https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/why-policies-and-procedures-manuals-are-dead-and-what-you-should-replace-them-wi.html)that over 8 out of 10 companies, out of 1000 businesses surveyed use formal policies and procedural manuals. \n\nThere are many other corporate documentation which comprises of documentation referring to companies policies and procedures as stated in he research above, instructional manuals, technical practices, behavioral and ethical documentation. As well as legal documentation which could be password protected. Also companies structures, best practices, and procedures, as well as maintenance manuals\n\n**Developer Documentation:** this type of documentation provides instructions for software product development, functional specifications, technical specifications, documentation, and tools to assist with developer workflow.\n\nNow that we better understand the different types of technical and product documentation let us discuss what the first steps of a solid management of product documentation development process begins with.\n\n### Locate a head of product documentation development\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_PsI4RmXQikpEACQlf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/eccf743b-f84f-655a-e8cb-52655df7bc4ccampaign_creators_gMsnXqILjp4_unsplash.jpg)\n\nA very typical issue is determining who should be in charge of the product documentation, not as someone who just updates it, but as someone who is accountable for the product's quality and success.\n\nWhile some businesses believe that each product owner and/or product manager is responsible for product documentation, as well as other departments such as development and support docs may also be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping user manuals, user guides and all facets of product documentation current and effective.\n\nThe development of product documentation has many moving parts but here we will point point two of them:\n\n1. Who understands how the product operates at all levels (this includes the product development and specifications teams as well).\n\n2. Those who receive input from customers who go through the product documentation and listen to their difficulties, feedback and concerns about understanding the product documentation at hand.\n\nThe first part helps us create the allotted product documentation with the knowledge at hand, and this gets sent out to the customer who in return give feedback and initiate the second processes which helps to optimize the documentation.\n\nSometimes these two points are not perfectly in place, and this produces situations in which the product documentation never receives the necessary attention.\n\nOne approach is to designate a person to be accountable for the, product documentation, product manuals and user guides \"performance.\" Consider a purchase order that has \"Product Documentation\" as his product. He is responsible for going through all of the company's teams, sketching out how each Product generates its guides and identifying the challenges associated with that process.\n\nThe intention is not for this product owner and product manager to be entirely responsible for generating and modifying manuals, but to assist individuals within each team on the with document management.\n\nThis individual should study how users interact with documents, offer ways to make updates more fluid, and gather feedback to determine how to enhance each product documentation and explainers with its intended audience.\n\nHaving someone in charge of all facets of product documentation, managing the workflow, and the different departments that are required to complete this documentation will increase productivity within the company, establish awareness and educating customers with knowledge portals about the product and over all streamline product comprehension.\n\n### Look at your product documentation as product itself.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_JdDBUtqTll6qYQgc9/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/cd6029ed-9933-9a5f-4007-c4d28888fa5ebram_naus_n8Qb1ZAkK88_unsplash.jpg)\n\nProducts exist to deliver a degree of value that meets or exceeds a customer's expectations. Based on [statistics generated by D2WorldWide](https://www.d2worldwide.com/product-documentation-why-do-customers-still-want-it-and-retailers-still-need-it/) 73.7% rate of people rate documentation more helpful than videos, packaging or salespeople when they are looking for information on products that they are considering on purchasing.\n\nConsider the factors that contribute to a product's attractiveness. There are several factors that can affect a product's attractiveness, but for the sake of this article, we will concentrate on three. They exceed expectations in terms of value; their usage generates satisfaction; and they are competitive.\n\nAdditionally, same concepts apply to good online product documentation. Product documents that go \"beyond the anticipated value\" illustrate not just how to use the specified item, but also offer solutions that the client is unaware of or does not feel are possible. It is always necessary to see how other companies initiate their product documentation in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.\n\nIt is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your technical product documents are unable to grasp them.\n\nConsider that the individual reading the product documentation may be unfamiliar with the range of possible solutions offered by the product or with the market (as is commonly the case with technical SaaS products), and so they must be \"educated\" about those solutions and various options related to the product.\n\nProduct documents whose \"usability generates satisfaction\" follow a logical reading pattern suited for their target audience. It serves no use to have the most thorough manual on the globe if it is a 500-page PDF or does not include a Code example and is not dynamically created with search capabilities, and other functions. Collect feedback from the users of your product document and your support personnel. They will ascertain the major areas of stress linked with the reported data.\n\nCompetitive product documentation are those that are continually updated using the most effective information exchange techniques. They have amazing features such as built in search capabilities, translations, different versions, embedded images, videos, and much more!\n\nEven if your integration guide is the best written of all technology businesses, it will lack the attraction without an added video, and images and codes which can be copy and pasted for ease of use for your tech savvy clients who purchase your technical SaaS products.\n\nIt is always necessary to see how other firms initiate their papers in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.\n\nIt is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your documents are unable to grasp them in all their entirety.\n\n**Product Documentation feedback**\n\nEffective technical product documentation enhances the end-user experience by polishing the process to understand products and diagnosing any problems with readily available written solutions. When customers trust and understand how to use your products your, they could come back to you in the future when the need arises.\n\n[New research made by SDL](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/) demonstrates that documentation's role in worldwide marketplaces is rising. [The research ](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/)shows that about 53% of buyers make purchases using technical literature before ever trying the product. Also, another compiled statistic from this research shows that 94% of buyers feel that having product information in one single location is helpful and useful. Because of this, each company places equal emphasis on product documentation as well as product development or testing these days.\n\nEven if the documentation has a designated owner who manages the documentation team, they have created product documentation that has been revised and assessed for improved usability, and has been properly updated, you continue to struggle to make your users and consumers comprehend your technical products. This might arise as a result of the users/reader's inability to comprehend how your documents are being read or the queries they are truly asking. This makes one of the most challenging aspects of document composition is putting oneself in the reader's shoes. After all, whomever produces the product documentation should have a solid understanding of the product.\n\nThis expertise may cause the writer to overlook things that are not so obvious to the average user. Typically, this occurs when something that is self-evident to people creating the product is not quite clear to those purchasing and using the product.\n\nThis can happen in a variety of ways:\n\n**Writing structure or form:** While this may appear to be a subjective word, even the manner in which a handbook is written can create confusion. It is critical to identify the sort of reader that reads the documentation; otherwise, words such as \"Developers prefer examples over descriptive text\" or \"Our documentation is not clear despite the presence of examples and visuals\" may occur.\n\n**Topic organized in manuals:** Occasionally, businesses operating in the same market develop a standardized documentation format. If your company guides do not adhere to it, the reader may have a sense of strangeness.\n\n**Excessive use of implicit terms:** When applied to a handbook, abbreviations may make little sense, even if the phrases are not acronyms. It's difficult to perceive, but some words, such as \"status\", \"id\", \"credentials\", and contain an implicit meaning disguised as explicit. Utilize particular designations, such as \"UserID,\" rather than \"UID.\"\n\n**Valid translation:** translation is a huge part of global reach. A lot of times companies create poorly translated user manuals and product documentation that does not match the culture of certain nations or simply the words do not translate the same way it would in English to that particular country. Understanding these subtle nuances can bring the product documentation a long way from unreadable information to a fully comprehensive and translated product documentation.\n\nTo avoid such situations, the aim is to develop a solution that gathers and analyses user feedback and navigation patterns.\n\nFeedback tools such as Vocally a Docsie feature is a great way to reive and evaluate navigation patters and survey how your customers are viewing your product documentation. [Learn the 7 golden rules of gathering feedback here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/)\n\nThis information is critical to update and optimize your user guides, user manuals and product documentation to create a more seamless experience for your customers to learn about your products. Nothing is more frustrating than introducing a new product and discovering an increase in Support requests due to poor manual instructions.\n\n## How to Write Comprehensive Product Documentation\n\nQuality product documentation is captivating, useful and powerful. I would argue that adept documentation is a necessary component of good product management. As much as product managers take a huge part in the development of products, a significant part of success is creating amazing polished product documentation that our customers can comprehend and use to further their knowledge about our products.\n\n\n\n### What is going on with most product documentation?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6UrbmSp116NpfVK1l/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/64a68ac0-4ef1-308c-ad6b-5ce4525f5301jeshoots_com__2vD8lIhdnw_unsplash.jpg)\n\nMany product managers are averse to drafting product documents. The product docs they are familiar with may not have traction with their customers unless more care is taken into making them appealing, easy to read and relate with.\n\nHowever, a lot of times companies do not take the care needed to create and craft amazing product documentation. Poor product documentation is written for the sole purpose of being written. It employs expansive phrases filled with vaguely acceptable thoughts and poor layout to discourage viewers from interacting with the material. A poor product documentation is created to shield the author from criticism and is a complete waste of everyone's time. And their customers dislike reading it because of this reason as well.\n\n### How do we fix this and write better product documentation which our customers will enjoy reading?\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NSTKBpS5BKDoj224Y/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d83ce28b-38c3-bb53-8a14-2e1212d0fc5cscott_graham_5fNmWej4tAA_unsplash.jpg)\n\nExcellent product documentation is written with the intention of being read. It is succinct. Good product documentation is well-formatted and can be read and comprehended by everyone in the company or customers in three minutes. It avoids jargon and either gives or refers to business-level viewpoint. An excellent product documentation spends time outlining specific use cases which the customers can understand and apply to the enhanced use of the product. It engages the reader and draws attention to underlying issues with well crafted solutions.\n\n### The potency of a well-written product documentation\n\nWhere there are small, medium, or big businesses, well-formatted technical product documents may save a lot of time and help employees work more productively. This is generally true of most product-based businesses, who spend a large percentage of their budgets on hiring technical writers and writing technical product documentation.\n\nIf your business employs more than two individuals to create product documentation, establishing a culture of good documentation is completely worthwhile. There are many reasons why you would want your team to create, manage and publish well-crafted product documentation but for the section below we will address how effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience.\n\n### Effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience\n\nSolid customer experience is the forefront of keeping and maintaining loyal customers. Most project managers are optimists \u2014 they get a concept, become enthusiastic, and then execute. While passion is admirable, and execution seems productive having a game plan before executing proper product documentation is vital.\n\nThe first steps after brainstorming a gameplan is initiating a design cycle and structure the product documentation content in such a way that it will be progressively easy for their customers to read. \n\nAlso, to gain feedback from their customers about their current documentation is a vital step needed in order to restructure the docs to match the customers needs. This way project managers can create, manage, maintain, publish and optimize their documentation with perception and automation. This is not a simple and miniscule task, and having amazing tools like [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)which automates a lot of the processes for making product documentation effective is quite essential for success.\n\nAttractive, engaging, and navigable technical documentation helps consumers learn the product in less time, which increases the likelihood that they will set up the product correctly and use it correctly.\n\nAll these strategies of creating well-polished product documentation will essentially lead to higher rated products, more favorable reviews, and more sales are all tied to one other; therefore, it goes without saying that the increased sales as a result.\n\n## How to create well-crafted product documentation\n\nHow to produce effective documentation and foster a culture where it is the standard? Writing effective documentation is challenging, and but there are many good features within [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)that can help seed up this process of making well crafted and dynamic product documentation portals. The following is a high-level summary of how we approach the issue.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yl3vJ0vYDWgB1AnFf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/7b97f8c4-af64-8ddc-c06b-93e6f28fea96dayne_topkin_y5_mFlLMwJk_unsplash.jpg)\n\n### Now lets get started:\n\n**Page limitations ensure readability.** Writing a decent document shouldn\u2019t be difficult to read and mentally process. Protracted, meandering phrases are frequently indicative of a lack of clarity. If the communication cannot be properly summarized on a single page, it is an indication that the product manager should probably go back and further break down the situation.\n\n**Formatting improves the quality**. A poorly structured product documentation increases the likelihood that the writer will wing it. Create a template with well-formatted sections, tables, and document headers. It's a one-time investment with high dividend potential.\n\n**Templates help you save time. **It's far easier to delete a section from a template than to remember to add one. It is not patronizing; rather, it is effective and time saving. Simple sections that remind the writer to begin with the broad background and to be specific about measurements or hazardous assumptions enable more precise writing and decision hierarchy.\n\n**Comment and assign tasks** There is no surer way to demotivate your staff from producing high-quality documentation than by failing to remark on them. Comments do not need to be very smart; rather, they should indicate involvement and serve as a model. While it is ideal to provide feedback digitally so that others in the company may benefit asynchronously from the conversation, a simple feature in Docsie which allows you to comment and collaborate with your team works product documentation team great!\n\nCheck out this blog to learn more about how Docsie helps with Product Documentation Collaboration\n\n**https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/collaboration-to-create-well-polished-product-documentation/**\n\n**Document types should be scalable to meet the demands of your company.** As more stakeholders get involved in the product development process, communication must be divided into several documents (particularly if the one-page 'conciseness' criteria is to be met). Docsie allows for a useful and sustainable solution for growing product documentation teams.\n\n## Use Docsie as a way to speed up awesome product documentation creation\n\nDocsie is a very handy platform that helps you with every aspect of product documentation and knowledge portal creation.

In this article I would like to jump into plugins that each Docsie knowledge portal and product documentation can add-on to their documentations to enhance them and improve their over all usability.\n\n## Docsie plugins to make your Documentation portal dynamic!Docsie has a bunch of plugin you can use to make your documentation more appealing. In this blog I will divide it into 3 parts. \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_4LttTJbkU67oXkSZX/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/898e185c-08b3-55da-e9c4-1031ad6792f5Snag_c3ee39d.png)\n\nIn this section we will divide the explanation of these knowledge portal plugins into three parts.\n\n**PART 1: **The first part we will show what we will show what the 'Display Version Picker', 'Display Language Picker', the 'Display Section Anchors', and the 'Display Footer Navigation\n\n**PART 2: **In this part we will show the 'Code Highlighting', 'Search', and the 'Share to Social Network' plugin\n\n**PART 3: **In part three we will show the 'Image Preview, 'Document Metadata', and the 'Auto-highlight Section' plugin.\n\n\n\nBefore we jump into the plugins lets talk about how to access these plugins within the Docsie Platform.\n\nFirst, within the workspace, we need to click onto the three dots at the top right corner and open our account: \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Mv9BSfFjt63Bq12ui/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/4ee73eb8-90f3-4588-7cad-537d6c3d2606Snag_fb448a0.png)\n\nThen within Deployments we can access the Plugins once we create a new Deployment via 'Configure a new deployment+' \n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_EyeRwNDqJuiL6yclc/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c3aa28de-aeff-0f8e-5b66-3e0f7cbdc564Snag_fb8dbd4.png)\n\nThen click 'More options' which will allow you to add these plugins into your Deployed documentation via your an imbedded script or via the Docsie portal\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_3BNU4lygMNvB6VhgK/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c16fe2e1-c05b-4574-1b90-5beb78b1ccceSnag_fb8f18f.png)\n\nThe other option is to access Docsie's knowledge portals plugins through the 'Update deployment configuration' button below your already published documentation.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yyBINqSBGXHuXCVFM/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/683c9259-3895-8af4-44c4-bfd25e802bc7image.png)\n\nIt will open this dashboard and then you can add or take away plugins as you see fit and then update the deployment.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8LSwF7TSbZcIAXkeg/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/df9df9ae-e562-9d25-2bdd-8253a7af8668image.png)\n\n### PART 1:\n\nNow that we know how to access the Docsie Pluggin lets jump into **PART 1**.\n\nIn order to see **part 1 **video tutorial please check out this video here:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3VraeLQkEc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\nlets start with the 'Display version Picker', and the 'Display Language Picker' \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_9F8xevNxryqXJuual/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/3539432f-5e55-7c68-c8ff-6e10ccaaf16fimage.png)\n\nOnce these two are active they will appear on the bottom left of your knowledge portal as floating tabs.  They allow your customers and those reading your product documentation to view your product docs in different languages and versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_15B6AEHxast4mhcXQ/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/3dc1ff60-4be8-3457-f12c-be1f2bbff93aimage.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_l5TJuQjEKYHFB1uKf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/67756830-5264-edcc-cc47-ff4f83901882image.png)\n\nOnce the user presses the Language within the language picker it will change their entire documentation that they are reading into that allotted language.\n\nThe Display Section anchor once activated allows your customer to have links next to each header which will give them links to certain sections of the documentation.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yKD6jx7Sg0HdhzQ95/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d5797b47-678b-f896-0387-9fb4ad7588e8image.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_xfEuNCfFm3uRLsjgt/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/970f06ac-8fee-01f0-31fd-9b86800347aeimage.png)\n\nEvery time these links are pressed, apart of the header will change and when your customer copies and pasts this html, it will direct the person they are sending it to, to this specific section of the documentation.\n\nNext is 'Display Footer Navigation' \n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_OUljvQnuFNAphGApN/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/aa4b47a1-72d2-3218-9cb6-96c7afe5d813image.png)\n\nThis plugin adds a navigation button at the bottom right of your documentation Book. It looks something like this.\n\n \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_56mbG9THAGa94XROc/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/90593fea-48fa-92d7-b3de-dbc4955c7c0fimage.png)\n\nThis way your customers can more comfortably navigate through your documentation.\n\n### PART 2:\n\nIn order to see **Part 2 **video tutorial please check out this video here:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JUFlG9DCGg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\nIn this part we will show the 'Code Highlighting', 'Search', and the 'Share to Social Network' plugin\n\n\n\nNow lets start with the 'Code Highlighting' plugin \n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_HLyqacquYY5uqmuC5/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/0afe135b-47fa-0e1a-f94f-5460bf448c5fimage.png)\n\nThis plugin is great for technical products which need to express various codes to their customers.
