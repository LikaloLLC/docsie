To get started, it's completely free, and you can build your first training manual in under 10 minutes. Once you are signed up we can begin to explain how to write a training manual through Docsie.\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Create a book to make an awesome basic training manual template.\n\nDocsie is based on the concept of books and shelves, with books serving essentially as instructional manuals and shelves serving as departments and knowledge base hubs.\n\nAssume you're a busy sales team with a need to have all of your outbound training materials in one place. You may use Docsie to organize and categorize your training manuals using sets. You can then invite the rest of the training team to collaborate and build better training manuals together once you're ready.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_qd5uDhTnzIv7i7usI/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/eeee9ae3-949a-4a68-ff86-1774bdad3340image.png)\n\n## Step 3 - Define training instructions\n\nThis is where you'll identify the training categories and pathways you'll need to create to order to educate your target audience.\n\nKeep in mind that this guide assumes that you already know who your target audience is; this guide's aim is to show you how to easily build content for your instructional training manual.\n\nConsider a sales force. It has beginner and advanced sales tracks for a variety of positions, including SDRs (Sales Growth Representatives), Account Executives, Customer Success Representatives, and so on. The positions can have different names and responsibilities depending on the nature of your sales company, but they all require training manuals and a traceable way to share information.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_G26esoODDFXA7gBlw/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0bbdb8bd-8fa4-5057-8bb2-4816e06b647aimage.png)\n\nAs a result, once you've identified your training tracks, you can start interviewing experts in those positions to help you determine the content for those tracks. As an example, you could interview an account executive to learn more about how they work.\n\nOnce you know their everyday routine, practices and duties you'll construct a process diagram that details the tasks of that specific job, giving you a clear picture of those responsibilities.\n\nYou'll then break down those duties into actionable steps by stage/seniority, which will make creating a training manual a breeze because you will know what and how to write a manual for your specific team.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_h2VzPUoPrfLAgyWSZ/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/426f2d7b-d360-d8d2-3042-01b6797217c2image.png)\n\nOnce you have completed gathering enough information, you can use it to develop your training material using a training manual template.\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Develop training materials\n\nFollowing the outline and road map you drew up for yourself in the previous steps, and armed with the information gathered from your team.

It will significantly simplify and improve the workflow of your training manual.\n\nInstructional manual templates play an important role in employee training by informing new employees about the organization and its procedures. Employees are maturing and learning new technologies, techniques, and processes.\n\nEmployees who aren't actively learning or who aren't knowledgeable about the devices, applications, equipment, or machinery used by their company may become disengaged at work.\n\nHowever, disengagement often leads to high employee turnover and poor work satisfaction. In the end, both the employers and employees suffer losses.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, there are statistics to back this up:\n\n\n\nWithin a year, 40% of workers with inadequate training quit their jobs.\n\nBecause of a lack of growth opportunities, 74 percent of workers feel they are not reaching their full potential at work.\n\nEmployees consider contributing financially to training in 72 percent of cases.\n\n\n\nAccording to 68 percent of employees, the company's most important agenda is growth and training.\n\nJust 13% of workers worldwide are engaged.\n\n\n\nEmployee disengagement costs the economy more than $500 billion each year.\n\nThe numbers, on the other hand, are endless. The problem is real. Employees want to grow and improve their skills in both traditional training and developmental opportunities.\n\n\n\nA great way for businesses to get started on this much-needed method is to create a fantastic company training guide or training manual.\n\n\n\nWe need to get down to the point and figure out what the most important aspects of a fantastic training manual would be and how to write a manual.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, 45 percent of learning hours in a typical company were created by online or even e-learning methods, according to the ATD (Association-for-Talent-Development-in-the-United-States). In comparison to 2015, this represents a 42 percent increase.\n\n\n\nThe ability to develop an instruction manual template is a natural skill that is necessary for business continuity and growth."}, "summary": {"hash": "56cc1dd40831181b1f8f8d0c9ba4d252", "content": "How leading organizations gain a competitive advantage by keeping their training manuals plain, succinct, and highly successful."}, "categories": {"hash": "3413fc6d30f65b3f06e64fa267cb5539", "content": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Best Practices", "Product Documentation Tutorials"]}, "is_legacy": {"hash": "f8320b26d30ab433c5a54546d21f414c", "content": false}}
