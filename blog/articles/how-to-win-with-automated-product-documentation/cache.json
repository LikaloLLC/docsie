Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way \u2013 so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.\n\n### Organization And Visual Dashboard Designs\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_KcRBWUiCJ0UoEUOKC/f86c49a8-1b13-5d38-2fbe-f671f02cfaecmaxim_ilyahov_blf4r69ltgw_unsplash.jpg)\n\nThe Docsie platform works on the principle of pushing product documentation and content to its end user environments in a centralized and organized way. So much of today's software development world is built around this kind of visual dashboard approach, where it's the format and the intuitive interface that matter most.\n\nWith a great cloud hosted interface, it's easy to unify your product documentation, tackle the learning curve, and publish your content to the web \u2013 seamlessly and effortlessly. That cloud model is very useful \u2013 that\u2019s why cloud services took over twenty-first century business so fully and quickly. But it has to be set up right!\n\n### Virtual Books and Virtual Shelves\n\nHere's another component of that virtual organization that drives [Docsie\u2019s](https://www.docsie.io/) product documentation processes.\n\nWithin our interface, you'll see [virtual shelves holding discrete numbers of virtual books](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/using-docsie-library/moving-and-copying-documents/) that contain your content and documentation, and the tools to move items with key automations.\n\nThis [object-driven mentality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300921) is part of how we help our clients to onboard staff quickly and efficiently, with the system that everyone can learn to use confidently. You could think of it as the \u201cGithub for documentation\u201d \u2013 in many ways, it\u2019s that same process of building a context for information that is popular, easy to understand, and then universally adopted.\n\n### Collaborative Tools\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_9A6GNIUeIDG1bUZID/bf6dc944-2db5-e845-f946-37c7e99ee813marvin_meyer_syto3xs06fu_unsplash.jpg)\n\nIn any content process, there are usually multiple stakeholders \u2013 people and parties working together to get the right information to the right destination.\n\nThat's also a huge part of how Docsie works, and how we have thoughtfully designed the platform to deliver. Through the documentation workflow processes in our model, it becomes easier to see what each participant is doing within a collaborative pipeline.\n\nPublishing Automations Make Content Portable\n\nEssentially, the[ JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) automations that we built Docsie on are an example of how API documentation tools and related resources work to allow clients to publish anywhere, instead of being confined to one isolated Wordpress silo or other shuttered destination. That versatility is at the core of how a unified documentation and content system releases its goods to the world \u2013 how you move things from drafts or beta into the full production phase.\n\nWant to learn more about Docsie? Try one of our demos, or reach out to a friendly technician to get more information on what this type of platform can do for your business. You\u2019ll see that principle of transparency and frictionless documentation workflows at work, helping adopters to drive efficiencies and outpace the competition.\n\n"}, "summary": {"hash": "4a3448d8fb8016b66e2c20ba69035e41", "content": " Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way \u2013 so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.\n"}, "categories": {"hash": "020aa7450c7f4dc16767374dbca4e821", "content": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Best Practices", "Technical Writing", "Product Documentation Tutorials"]}, "is_legacy": {"hash": "f8320b26d30ab433c5a54546d21f414c", "content": false}}
