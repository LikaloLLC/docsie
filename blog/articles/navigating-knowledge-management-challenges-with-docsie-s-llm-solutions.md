In the business world, which is always changing, having complete and up-to-date product paperwork is essential for success. However, let's be honest: keeping good paperwork can be hard, but it can **leverage** the business. From the difficulties of API instructions to the tricky nature of delivering to multiple clients and overcoming **documentation challenges**, here are some of the most common issues that businesses have:

**1. Maintaining API product documentation**: It can be hard to keep API docs updated when things change so often.

These days, APIs are what make software work. However, updating their instructions with software that changes quickly can be hard. Docsie steps in to make this process go smoothly and quickly.

**2. Maintenance and permissions during product documentation**:  It takes too long to update and get document permissions.

Delays in getting updates to documentation accepted can make it harder to develop new products and help customers. Docsie speeds up the review process so that work can get done.

**3. Release Workflow:** There isn't a clear way to create new or updated product documents.

Docsie gives you a clear, organized way to release new paperwork, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

**4. Multi-Client Delivery**: The job of ensuring that documents are sent to the right people worldwide.

Customized paperwork is often needed for global clients. Docsie makes it easy to change material to fit the needs of different groups of people.

**5. White Labeling Needs for Knowledge Management**: It's hard to brand documentation sites for certain clients.

Branding your documents for different clients can be hard, but Docsie has white-labelling options that simplify the process.

**6. Customer dissatisfaction** The effect of bad documentation is more help calls and customer confusion because of bad documentation.

Customers get angry, more help calls happen, and misunderstandings happen when there isn't enough documentation. Docsie gives you the tools to make complete, clear guides.

**7. Direct Source Updates**: The need to change API docs from the source code by hand.

Docsie automatically changes the source code, so your API documentation stays up to date with little work from you.

**8. Alternatives to Documentation:** What are the cons of standard documentation versus in-app help?

Docsie is more than just documents; it also has in-app help for a more interactive and immersive **document management** experience.

**9. Lack of an LLM robot:** There isn't a chatbot for fixing problems in real-time.

The **Docsie LLM** chatbot can quickly help users fix product documentation problems, reducing user frustration and support calls.

**10. Product documentation problems with localization**: Has trouble translating and adapting documents for use in different countries.

Docsie makes translating and localizing documents easier for foreign markets so that more people can access them.

**11. [SOPs](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/creating-effective-sop-guidelines-examples-templates/)**, Compliance, and Audits:** It can be hard to keep SOPs and job tools up to date and ready for daily employee tasks, as well as to ensure that everyone follows the rules and is ready for internal and external audits.
