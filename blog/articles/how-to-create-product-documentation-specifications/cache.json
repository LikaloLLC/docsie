WHY? Simply because technical communication skills are necessary for capturing information and assisting the audience in gaining a better understanding of the product or technology we are selling.\n\nWhile communication in the real world occurs through the use of words or expressions, technical communication occurs through the use of Technical Documentation in the virtual world!\n\nTechnical product documentation is created with the sole purpose of assisting the end user in comprehending the operation and architecture of the product or technology they are using. It's more of a detailed description of a product's nuts and bolts \u2013 a \"how-to-use\" manual for new employees, users, and anyone else who needs to know how it works!\n\nHowever, as straightforward as it sounds, technical documentation can be perplexing! The majority of technical documents contain multiple phases, ranging from \"How to use: If you're new and have limited experience\" to \"How to troubleshoot: In the event of a bug or error\"\n\nTherefore, if you're unsure where to begin, here's a comprehensive guide that will assist you in answering the what, why, and how of technical documentation, while also simplifying the process!\n\n### Let us begin!\n\nYou've come to the correct spot if you're new to product documentation and have never had to develop a product documentation specification.\n\nWhile you may have mastered the fundamentals of creating a product documentation specification, putting it into action requires thinking and a committed approach.

Additionally, it may include the persona or consumer for whom the product is being created but this mainly applies to products who are intended for certain age groups.\n\nThis product documentation specification should be extremely clear, easily accessible, and contain all of the information required by your design team and product team. Include as much detail as possible to ensure that your technical writing team understand what to write and your designing team understand the layout of your product documentation. A table or chart of written specifications will indicate where more information may be located. Bear in mind, however, that this is only the product documentation specification sheet - you may leave the specifics of detail oriented aspects of the product to be written within your product documentation to your team for later installments of work.\n\n## What Information Should a Product Documentation Specification Contain?\n\n![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784881475-0e408bbca849?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHBsYW5uaW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyODE4OTkyNA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)\n\nEach product specification is built around technical requirements, engineering specifications, and other product-specific information.

If you are demonstrating features of a digital SaaS product then having snippets of these features works wonders as long as you demonstrate what they do, and how they work.\n\nAdditionally, images help break up the monotony of words and provide interest to the paper. Captions can assist in putting product diagrams and drawings with clear directions into perspective.\n\n### Reread, edit and rewrite:\n\nGo over your technical documentation multiple times to ensure you haven't missed anything!
