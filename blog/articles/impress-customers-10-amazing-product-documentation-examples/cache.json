As the product moves from a proof of concept to a reality, explanatory documentation is essential for educating customers on how to use your product.\n\nWhat are the first things a customer needs to know when choosing a product? What is it for, what does it do, and how do I do it? Let\u2019s use Docsie as an example!\n \nDocsie is a product documentation platform. It allows users to create, edit, annotate and publish documentation in an online knowledge portal. It\u2019s as simple as logging in, creating a new Docsie Book, and typing your first piece of content!\n\nAdmittedly, we kept it simple. For product documentation, however, complex features and functions require more comprehensive explanations to drive the concept home.\n\nIn this article, we will explore 10 of Docsie teams\u2019 favorite examples of amazing product documentation. Better yet? We will also show you how to make amazing product documentation of your own (inspired by our amazing examples!)\n\nLet\u2019s dive in! \ud83e\udd3f\n\n## 10 Amazing Product Documentation Examples\n\nBelow, you will find 10 amazing product documentation examples selected by the Docsie team. We will explore how to replicate features and functions, and create similarly amazing documentation of your own in Docsie!\n\n### 1 - Docker\n\nDocker is a container virtualization platform that enables software hosting within tiny, modular and individually isolated IT environments. The concept allows for multiple disparate services to be hosted on a single host operating system by splitting and sharing operating system resources between containers.\n\n>[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)\n\n![Docker Documentation Portal Homepage](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/oywtjgyzfpsynkqslptj \"Docker Documentation Portal Homepage\")\n\nDocker has a clearly formatted product documentation portal, and presents all the essential information needed to download, install and get up and running with Docker containers. It also shares multi-lingual product documentation, API reference documentation, and a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section at the bottom. For the visual learners, there is also a video section in the bottom right.\n\nTo create a Getting Started section, let\u2019s use Docsie as an example. To start in Docsie, you must create an account, confirm your email address, load the Docsie Workspace dashboard, create a new Shelf, create a new Book \u2013 that\u2019s the basics done! Create a framework of header titles for each section, write instructions, add pictures and hyperlinks and you will end up with a similar structure to below!\n\nThe best part? Docsie does this for you auto-magically!\n\n![Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ohzwitemzfuhcekepxex \"Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation\")\n\n>[See how this is done in Docsie, read the Docsie Quick Start guide!](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/quick-start/)\n\n### 2 - Stripe\n\nStripe is an international payment processing platform with technical functionality that enables custom integrations and payment parameters using the Stripe command-line-interface (CLI). Its mission statement is to increase the GDP of the internet by building virtual economic infrastructure that streamlines eCommerce.\n\n>[Read more about the Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)\n\n![Stripe CLI documentation page with code highlighting examples](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/zpxindusvnjuriyzpock \"Stripe CLI documentation page with code highlighting examples\")\n\nThis Stripe page is known as technical product documentation. It explores how to use a CLI to create Docker containers (hello again!) and communicate with Stripe using nothing but terminal commands. On the page you will see a Table of Contents, code blocks with copy-paste functionality, and in-text hyperlinks.\n\nDocsie has code blocks, so let\u2019s explore how to use them\n\n>[Check out this Code Blocks Example in Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/plugins-extensions/add-code-highlighting/)\n\n> Copy this code ready to follow our example - `console.log('Hello World');`\n\nOpen a Docsie Book in the Docsie Editor. The GIF below shows how to find the Code Block option in the toolbar, and contains a JavaScript example that prints \u201cHello World!\u201d\n\n![Animated GIF showing how to add code blocks to Docsie Books](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/dvofsbntefhpqxzetglx \"Animated GIF showing how to add code blocks to Docsie Books\")\n\nIn your Docsie Portal, code highlighting is applied to improve clarity for technical readers. Users can even copy the code with the handy clipboard icon!\n\n![Live Docsie Portal rendering for code blocks example](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cgnoqwpldvdycrhyzqzr \"Live Docsie Portal rendering for code blocks example\")\n\n>[See how to apply the Code Highlighting plugin in Docsie!](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/publish-documentation-portal/?doc=/plugins-extensions/add-code-highlighting/)\n\n### 3 - Apple\n\nThe ubiquitous Apple! No, not the edible kind!\n\nApple offers some excellent product documentation for its popular iPhone line of smartphones. In our Apple product documentation example, we have a version picker, table of contents, text and headers, and finally in-line images.\n\n![Apple iPhone Documentation Page](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/xvuspkjrqcaxcncgqzbq \"Apple iPhone Documentation Page\")\n\nLet\u2019s explore version control in Docsie!\n\n>[Read our guide on managing versions in Docsie! ](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/managing-versions/)\n\nWhen reading documentation in a Docsie knowledge portal, readers can select a version using the version picker plugin.\n\n![Version picker in Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/vasmwlrjywxcrzbvjinl \"Version picker in Docsie Portal\")\n\nThis allows readers to view historical product documentation \u2013 you know, for those slow pokes at the back who haven\u2019t updated yet!\n\nTo create a new version in Docsie, use the version management tab in Docsie Editor.\n\n![Version selection menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cidsyyjlzvzipcoogjrn \"Version selection menu in Docsie Editor\")\n\nFrom here, click Add version + .\n\n![Add Version button in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/nvsbfjwaqyniyqlnagvl \"Add Version button in Docsie Editor\")\n\nNext, choose a version number and version name before clicking the Add version button. It\u2019s that easy! Update the new version document with any feature changes, and let your customers find the latest (or late-ish) information!\n\n![Add Version context options menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ozelvlpwguxzksamascl \"Add Version context options menu in Docsie Editor\")\n\n### 4 - Parse\n\nParse is an excellent full stack software platform that provides open-source frameworks for application backends. Simply, it offers pre-made code resources that developers can trust when integrating with any development project.\n\nIn the Parse documentation portal, there is a great documentation example in the form of compatibility tables. This monitors the compatibility of different architectures like Node.js and MongoDB with the Parse platform.\n\n![Example version compatibility table on Parse website](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hkytunqwvoqlcsnwymgk \"Example version compatibility table on Parse website\")\n\nLet\u2019s make this in Docsie!\n\nWe can make a four column table similar to the Parse example using table blocks in Docsie.\n\n![Docsie table block icon with four column option highlighted](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/jwmmuikvpbcagcqtkqky \"Docsie table block icon with four column option highlighted\")\n\nSelect the table block icon, then the four column option.\n\nAs you type, use the Enter key to move along the columns. Use Ctrl + B on the keyboard to make text bold. Finally, add emojis using the symbol option.\n\n![Replicated four column table in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/awevjvzwxxxmspzcsesz \"Replicated four column table in Docsie Editor\")\n\n![Symbol selection menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cunoxhrnzcfkcuncyqlq \"Symbol selection menu in Docsie Editor\")\n\n![Emoji and symbol selection table for Symbol context menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/bbxeheaefvtzwkaeuavz \"Emoji and symbol selection table for Symbol context menu in Docsie Editor\")\n\n>[Learn about the Docsie Editor toolbar.](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/)\n\nThis is an easy way to write API documentation and technical software documentation. You can go further by adding hyperlinks to the Node.js website, or internal links to relevant user guides. Deliver your next API compatibility table in Docsie!\n\n### 5 - Flutter\n\nFlutter is a UI toolkit created by Google to drive consistency in user interface design across mobile, web, desktop and embedded devices. It promotes fast UI design and development with an online code editor, and a layered container-based architecture allows for full customization.\n\nFlutter hosts a range of videos for users to watch and learn about the platform. As the platform is made by Google, YouTube is the logical choice for our example!\n\n![Flutter YouTube video examples on page](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/gdcgtpfnocqjnrjxmffb \"Flutter YouTube video examples on page\")\n\nYou can emulate this design in Docsie using video embed blocks!\n\n![How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/aomjofizmdvjafyfpean \"How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar\")\n\nSimply click within your Docsie Book, select the video embed icon, then copy the YouTube URL into the text field.
