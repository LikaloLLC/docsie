Discovering errors:\n\nIn the case of HATs, code editing and text editing are the principal features. HATs eliminate errors and break down the complex writing process into simple steps. They offer grammar suggestions and create templates which companies can work on to create customised content.\n\n\nBy developing automated language style guides with the help of HATs, companies can develop their brand language. When it comes to code editing, front-end web developers often use such tools. HATs also help brands in maintaining their documentation tone, format and appearance intact. \n\n### 2. Content management:\n\nA lot of the Help Authoring Tools available in the industry today share a set of similarities with content management systems (CMS). Shadowing the main function of CMS tools and platforms, HATs assist technical writers in managing their content projects, storing and tracking their progression. \n\nThe point where a HAT differs from a CMS is that a HAT has every content project linked to a particular set of files, helps, manuals and software explanation guides. While using a HAT, you can prevent data loss and also restore the last saved version of your documents. This is a super benefit of a HAT that lets you access valuable information even after facing an unpredictable technical glitch. \n\n### 3. File transactions:\n\nWhen you use HATs, you can easily import and export your files, ensuring seamless file transactions between multiple platforms. The good part is that you do not need to do convert each of your file manually. Through HATs, you can effortlessly work on the same file content and create multiple formats of the same document.  \n\nOnce you have multiple formats, what happens to your original document? Fear not, for the automatic conversion feature of the HATs lets you preserve the original documentation, keeping the structure and format intact. This decreases the possibility of errors, reducing time and effort. This feature becomes even more significant when content authors need to share their project files with other contributors. \n\n### 4. Improve content:\n\nWhen it comes to content creation, nothing can beat the importance of brainstorming to churn out fresh ideas. HATs streamline communication between teams, making remote working easier and ensuring constant collaboration between team members. There are other remarkable features like real-time editing, commenting and version control. Through these features, you can reduce miscommunication amongst your team members, increase productivity and reduce time and effort considerably. \n\nHATs are great tools that keep team members well-knitted in a close group. One of the noteworthy features of HATs includes track changes. This lets users switch between various versions of the same document, creating comprehensive and well-documented content. \n\n### 5. Publishing and maintenance:\n\nUpdating and maintaining documentation regularly is a tiring process. To ease things for its users, a HAT lets writers make changes to the preliminary source file following which updates are made to all the file formats. This ensures that all users remain up to date regarding the changes that are made and can access the final version of the file without any hassle. \n\nIn the case of publishing, HATs often provide templates so that technical authors can work on the already existing base-level formatting. The templates also suggest various kinds of visual layouts, making it easier for technical writers to pull videos, motion graphics, videos, etc. from other sources. \n\n## How is Docsie A HAT?\n\nWith technology and innovation at its core, Docsie is one of the leading Help Authoring Tools that creates new ways for teams to collaborate, create and implement product documentation.
