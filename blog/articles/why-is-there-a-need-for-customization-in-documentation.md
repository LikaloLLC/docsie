Launching your product in the market takes immense effort, not only from your end but from your team's end as well. They have to go back and forth, collaborate with different stakeholders, take care of all requirements, and improve interdepartmental collaboration. Product managers, back-end & front-end developers, and other tech team members sit together to brainstorm before launching any new releases. Going through this process means preparing multiple docs. How hectic is that for your team?

In times like these, having a platform that offers content customization, flexibility, and knowledge management features becomes a necessity. You get the shield you need while planning, tracking, communicating, and evaluating your project. 

## Why is there a need for customization in documentation?

Every project has its magnitude and importance. The size, complexity, scope, and risks related to a project decide how you need to adjust customization in documentation. Maintaining a knowledge base and adjusting a project's requirements with content customization tools play a pivotal role in helping you save time, avoid confusion, and align your team better. 

But how will you know if you need a customization tool for better project flow? Do you need to go through a certain set of procedures? Well, read on the next section to understand how to assess your need for project documentation. 

## How to assess project documentation needs?

The golden rule of business is to not hop onto anything without measuring the pros and cons of your decision. But let's keep the need for content customization away from this golden rule. 

To assess the need for project customization tools, you must consider the objectives, requirements, and expectations of your project documentation from different angles. To get clarity, you must ask questions relating to:

The scope of project documentation

Audiences and users

Uses of the product

Product-related standards and guidelines

Asking these questions will give you a clear picture on what platform to choose and what features to look for when planning to implement documentation tools. 

## How to identify the best match for a content customization tool?

In the last report published by [M-File on Intelligent Information Management](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/), they found that having an inefficient content customization tool can lead to workflow challenges. 65% of respondents in that survey mentioned they face challenges in reviewing, approving, and signing documents in the absence of a proper tool for knowledge base and content customization. 

It makes finding the right tool even more necessary. But how will you find that perfect match? Here are a few points to consider when looking for tools offering customization in documentation. 

### Identify a suitable mode of operation

Enterprise documentation has two modes: an on-site enterprise document management system and a cloud-based document management system. On-site DMS allows companies to access data from their own server but to use this tool, you must be present in the office's campus. However, cloud-based DMS tools offer greater flexibility to the remote workforce as they can get access to the data from anywhere. 

### Consider the cost factor

Cost is a deciding factor here. If you are going for an on-site DMS, expect to shell out large upfront costs to make team collaboration easier. However, if you are planning for a cloud-based system, you can expect the entire setup to be done in half the cost of on-site DMS. 

### Look for data security

Data security is a no-brainer. Your documents must be hacked-proof without even asking for it. In the case of on-site DMS, you have more control over security while the ownership of security lies on the shoulders of your service provider in the case of cloud-based DMS. 

### Option for backing up files

In the case of on-site DMS, the data files need to be backed up frequently as there is no automatic backup option. Therefore, the chances of data loss are higher. In the cloud-based system, the backup happens on its own. So you don't have to worry about data loss in case of unfortunate events. 

## 5 features to look for in documentation software

Creating a collaborative team space becomes easy when you have the right tools with you. Here is a list of features that you must look for when selecting the right documentation tools for your organisation. 

### 1. Document Sharing

When working with multiple stakeholders, you have to keep everyone on the same page. One of the ways to keep everyone involved in a project is by taking their opinions and making changes to the product in accordance with the valuable inputs received. A documentation content management platform should give the flexibility of sharing data in-house with clients and stakeholders. 

### 2. Security

Security should be the top priority when selecting documentation software suitable for your organization. Your preferred choice should have the latest security tools and software to ensure that only authorized people have access to data. 

### 3. Editing options

Finding the right document should not be a struggle for your team. 83% of employees lose their precious time[ recreating documents that already exist](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/). Therefore, the DMS should have the option of showing the updated version of the document first. Moreover, people with editing access to the doc must be able to make changes to it directly. 

### 4. Document classification

Document classification and labeling errors make it difficult for employees to find the right document on time. A good DMS must have the feature to create metadata automatically for docs once they are prepared by the team. This will free the team from the responsibility of creating names for the files, thus reducing manual errors and saving time. 

### 5. Keyword Search

The right documentation software should give the flexibility to the team to search for relevant documents using keywords. It should display relevant results on the screen to facilitate quicker doc search. 

Having these five incredible features in a documentation tool offers platform flexibility and helps your team save time in finding and editing the right documents. These features also help your organization enhance its planning, collaboration, evaluation, and knowledge management while handling different projects.
