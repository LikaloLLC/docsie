That\u2019s why the quality of customer service is a deciding factor for many MSPs.\n\n**Knowledge Base Features:** Can an app handle large knowledge bases? Does it offer editing tools to create functional documents? Can you collaborate across teams and third-party apps? You don\u2019t want to switch software only to find that it limits you in some way.\n\n**Value For Money:** Will the tool grow with you\u2014or will you have to switch *again* with scale? A good tool will support you at any level and only introduce features that you need.\n\n### Are low scores always bad?\n\nNot at all.\n\nFor example, a tool with integrated project management will have a higher *value *score, since you'll find it useful if you aren\u2019t already using a project management app. But if you are, those features only add *complexity, *which ultimately decreases the value.\n\nSimilarly, having few features might mean that the existing features are of higher quality. That\u2019s the case with specialised tools like Docsie: it can\u2019t manage passwords or devices, but it\u2019s the best knowledge base platform out there.\n\n*P.S. Want to build large knowledge bases without having to worry about stability, security, or scale?

Docsie.ai - Best App For Knowledge Base Management\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Mdm29hBsHFHmx4Mth/0735b5f9-52ef-0998-d6ab-147eb6dd463csnag_dcc60569.png)\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) is the best knowledge base management tools out there.\n\nIt specializes in **extensive IT documentation, cross-organizational data curation, and team collaboration**. Docsie is very easy to install and can integrate with any tech stack.\n\n**Top Docsie Features:**\n\n\u25cf Auto-Translate\n\n\u25cf UI Customization\n\n\u25cf Publishing Options\n\n\u25cf Powerful Editing Tools\n\n\u25cf Documentation Analytics\n\n\u25cf Deployment Management\n\n\u25cf Interactive Knowledge Portals\n\n\u25cf Intuitive Organization Structure\n\n\u25cf Internal & External Collaboration\n\nHere's [an example](https://portals.docsie.io/organization_14776/workspace_14776/welcome-to-docsie-red-beta-snead/welcome-to-docsieio/deployment_EmlWqzYM4A1oC5jcF/?doc=/welcome-to-docsieio/) of Docsie's documentation published on the web.\n\n\n\nDocsie's building blocks are *books *and *shelves*.\n\n*Shelves* are placed on the left side. Opening them will show you a list of *books*.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_pKrfGL3xBNPw0VWzy/467dfdac-7622-ba62-48be-cd614fe2882cimage.png)\n\nYou can group books into sections, like a real library.\n\nClicking on a book takes you to the editor. Here, you can create *articles*, and even translate them into *different languages* automatically. The editor is also where you manage the versions, visibility, and publishing for each article.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ey4kVnSN6KS0puzDz/5b540e19-1e98-570f-b887-f85735fbd178image.png)\n\nYou can embed multimedia content in articles, allowing you to create all kinds of documents \u2014 **internal SOPs, onboarding guides, and external wikis or help centers. **To stay secure, Docsie also offers robust access control.\n\nAs for publishing, you can publish whole shelves *or*single books.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Portal**\n\nYou can use Docsie\u2019s cloud to publish your document to the web.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Jcp0r6LpQjkYzeSXo/35e85914-9d15-68ae-ca3b-b40ee8b596f9image.png)\n\nThis creates a web link that you can share with anyone you want.\n\nMeaning your readers don\u2019t need a Docsie account to access your knowledge bases.\n\n\n\n### Website Embed\n\n**You can also embed a Docsie knowledge portal into an existing website.**\n\nThat means you can create and curate help centers, guides, blogs, and product documentation, and make them public on your website.\n\nTo find out about the full extent of Docsie features, check out our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQm591jTzvHwb003Y8e1XA/videos). We\u2019ve got a ton of videos explaining how it works. It\u2019s so simple you can figure it out in one afternoon and have it running by the end of the day.\n\n### Who Docsie.io Isn\u2019t For\n\nDocsie is a *specialized knowledge base*.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t include asset management for passwords, devices, or customers. You'll have to get separate software for those. But fear not because Docsie has robust [integration capabilities](https://www.docsie.io/es/vocally/documentation/integrations/), and can fit in any tech stack.\n\nIt\u2019s a great option if you want to keep your tech stack flexible with specialized apps.\n\n### Pricing\n\n**The Docsie \u201cstartup\u201d plan is free.**\n\nIt includes all the features you need to create and curate your knowledge base so you can get a good idea of how it works before committing to it. Higher plans have more features as shown below:\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_bJdTHHD4FfqgxQSA4/4749b3c6-22ed-c6b0-9a6b-81eeadcffb51snag_dce44cb2.png)\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that anyone can see the knowledge bases you create, as long as you make them public. Meaning you **don\u2019t need a team account for every user that wants access to the documents**.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n**Docsie is a documentation specialist.**\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to expand your tech stack with a best-in-class knowledge base\u2026 or if you don\u2019t need the complexity of a general MSP software like ITglue\u2026 then Docsie is the best solution.\n\n*Sick of upgrading plans so your team can access documents?

Hudu - Best Direct Alternative To ITglue\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_pCiGVBAQWgNoH1YKO/10d972b6-df42-5ddd-da03-70930f8a9314snag_dcef3bc4.png)\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n[Hudu](https://www.hudu.com/) is the newcomer on the MSP block that everyone is talking about. It\u2019s a direct competitor to ITglue so it will be right up your alley if you\u2019re an ITglue veteran.\n\n**Top Hudu Features:**\n\n\u25cf Custom assets\n\n\u25cf Expiration tracking\n\n\u25cf Website monitoring\n\n\u25cf Intelligent reporting\n\n\u25cf Knowledge retention\n\n\u25cf Employee accountability\n\n\u25cf It acts as a password vault\n\n\u25cf Secure information sharing\n\n\u25cf Built-in process management\n\nUnlike ITglue, Hudu is self-hosted, so your data security is in your hands instead of a third-party\u2019s.\n\nAnother reason why Hudu took the market by storm is its customer service. Many users report faster response times and better problem-solving than what ITglue offers.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Ld8qvOUPjWopB9SBl/06c352a7-76cc-d45e-e5c1-26d91ca5706aimage.png)\n\nCheck out [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzkf25_e-2g&ab_channel=Hudu) if you want to get a better feel for Hudu and its features.\n\n### Where Hudu Falls Short\n\nIf you\u2019re switching from ITglue, you should know that Hudu isn\u2019t as feature-rich. Although the dev team has a fast release cycle and is catching up fast. Especially since Hudu listens to customer feedback a lot more than ITglue does.\n\nAnother consideration is the current lack of a hosted service, which is still in development.\n\n### Pricing\n\n[Hudu\u2019s pricing](https://www.hudu.com/pricing.html) is simple.\n\n**$31/month for 3 users + $15/user/month for additional users.**\n\nIt has a 14-day free trial and no setup fees or contracts. Annual billing plans come with a 10% discount.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nMany unhappy ITglue customers flocked to Hudu since it launched.\n\nIt\u2019s the best option if you\u2019re looking for a cheaper alternative to ITglue but don\u2019t want to compromise on any functionality.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that compared to Docsie, both Hudu and ITglue are more expensive, and their knowledge base and documentation features aren\u2019t as advanced.\n\n## 3. Confluence - Best For Large Teams And Organizations\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_kFQZd3eXlOJsxQyQ8/c3d00fb6-7c3f-f43c-ba76-488dcdf25f21snag_dcf13f74.png)\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)is a collaboration tool from Atlassian.\n\nIt allows you to create project plans, schedule tasks, write meeting notes, discuss work, and submit project requirements in a collaborative work environment. It also offers documentation management and the creation of internal wikis. By syncing documents, you can collaborate online for document creation.\n\n**Top Confluence Features:**\n\n\u25cf Analytics\n\n\u25cf Atlassian integrations\n\n\u25cf Robust customer support\n\n\u25cf Unlimited spaces and pages\n\n\u25cf Team & Project management\n\n\u25cf Internal & External Collaboration\n\n\u25cf Powerful permission management\n\nConfluence is lauded as a stable product and it allows easy integration with agile processes.\n\nHere\u2019s [a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJmdvoXeQs&ab_channel=RCVAcademy) if you\u2019re interested in how Confluence works.\n\n### Where Confluence Falls Short\n\nConfluence is a complex program.\n\nFor new users, the syntax is confusing and it takes a while to learn how to navigate the program. Also, Confluence is the worst on this list in terms of knowledge base management.\n\n### Pricing\n\nConfluence has a generous free version. It includes all of the essential documentation features\u2014including unlimited pages and spaces\u2014for a team of 10 users.\n\nConfluence is also the cheapest paid product on this list. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that advanced features are only available as paid plugins which can quickly ramp up the cost.\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Hc9ZKEDEPhAsLYLfe/df69b0b8-42e5-2df3-9d57-ac0433f7f02bsnag_dcf32933.png)\n\n### Bottom line\n\nConfluence is a no-brainer if you\u2019re already using other Atlassian apps like Jira. It's also the best choice for massive teams since the base product's pricing plans are very scalable.\n\nThe major drawback is the subpar documentation features, which get convoluted if you\u2019re dealing with large knowledge bases.\n\n*If you\u2019re looking for a powerful knowledge base management tool, look into D[ocsie.io ](https://www.docsie.io/)and try it free for as long as you like!*\n\n## 4. IT Portal - Best For Small Teams\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_1fv8wS3rWKb8RG3Ej/78d2c20d-e0b6-8d75-a40d-e4a713dc9f5aimage.png)\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n[IT Portal](https://www.it-portal.com/v4/) is a flexible asset management software. You can use it to keep track of knowledge bases, docs, passwords, people, and configurations that can run on their cloud or your own.\n\nCompared to ITglue, IT Portal is more straightforward to use and more customizable. It's responsive, quick, and stable. And all the information is reachable with the browser extension plugin.\n\n**Notable IT Portal Features:**\n\n\u25cf Mobile App\n\n\u25cf Scoreboard\n\n\u25cf Portal Export\n\n\u25cf Device Import\n\n\u25cf Network Import\n\n\u25cf Integrated File Editors\n\n\u25cf Password Manager & Browser Plugin\n\nIT Portal is known to have better customer support than ITglue: quick to respond and fast to action.\n\nThe integration feature is also nothing to sneeze at. It integrates with various common software like RMM, Office365, ticket management, etc. which further enriches the value of your tech stack.\n\n### Where IT Portal Falls Short\n\nIn terms of features, both products are very similar. But IT Portal's UI is awkward and feels outdated compared to ITglue.\n\n### Pricing\n\nIT Portal is priced per number of users \u2014 the more users, the less per user you have to pay.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_QUjnR2SvHrfGixfp2/f91bf950-daf7-18ab-e5fa-05c5a9c9271esnag_dcf4d82b.png)\n\nThey also provide on-premise hosting.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_sCjJmF9mDYBBNTTOg/f3d2ce97-53e3-0921-fd97-76c88fe69096snag_dcf537cf.png)\n\nIf you buy a yearly plan, they offer a 10% discount for up to 9 users and a 20% discount above that.\n\nThey also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee if you want to test it out.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nIT Portal is a cheap alternative to ITglue for small teams, but its costs quickly balloon for larger teams if you aren\u2019t hosting it yourself. It\u2019s a good ITglue alternative if the dated UI doesn\u2019t bother you.\n\n**Compared to Hudu:** If price is a big factor for you, chose Hudu. Otherwise\u2014if you don\u2019t care about the UI\u2014It comes down to the integrations. We recommend looking at what integrations you want and choosing based on that.\n\n## 5. DokuWiki - Best Free Alternative\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_D4NBY2yrE0P4lqaKw/5283b22f-4f66-6d03-241e-c4bac208c23esnag_dcf5f478.png)\n\n### Features & Benefits\n\n[DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) is a simple to use and versatile open source wiki software.\n\nIt features a clean and easy-to-read syntax. As the name implies, DokuWiki is made for documentation, manuals, and descriptions. It\u2019s possible to create nicely formatted and easy-to-read documentation with its editing tools.\n\n**Notable DokuWiki Features:**\n\n\u25cf Backup and integration\n\n\u25cf Built-in access controls\n\n\u25cf Features revision control\n\n\u25cf Authentication connectors\n\n\u25cf Integrates with your website\n\nDokuWiki lets you create your own or community-made plugins to add any feature you like. The many plugins contributed by its community enable a broad range of uses beyond those of a typical wiki.\n\n### Where DokuWiki Falls Short\n\nDokuWiki was released in 2004 and hasn\u2019t been updated since.\n\nBecause of that, it doesn\u2019t look as clean as modern-day apps. It also has security risks that can be mitigated with proper network access configuration.\n\nThe original creators also don\u2019t offer any official customer support, although many organizations offer [officially recognized third-party support services](https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq:support) in DokuWiki\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n### Pricing\n\nDokuWiki is free.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nDokuWiki is a good choice if you\u2019re ok with the older look and don\u2019t have *any*budget to spend on other options. Security is a concern though, so it\u2019s smart to upgrade to a paid tool after your business grows.\n\n*If you're looking for a cutting-edge knowledge base tool that offers top-notch security and accessibility, Docsie.io is the perfect collaborative environment. Sign-up for the free version h[ere!](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/)*\n\n## Final Verdict: Which ITglue alternative should you choose?\n\nIt\u2019ll be different for every team or MSP, but every product offers a free trial that lets you test what\u2019s best for you risk-free.\n\nBut if you ask us, if you're looking for a:\n\n**powerful database management** tool that doesn\u2019t work against you: [Docsie.io](https://www.docsie.io/),\n\n**cheaper ITglue alternative **with better customer support: [Hudu](https://www.hudu.com/),\n\n**free database** alternative: [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki).\n\n"}, "summary": {"hash": "1a41817b61c82fd3f16dde333f50f6e9", "content": "We've categorised the software based on four criteria most important for MSPs."}, "categories": {"hash": "8720635f43c3e1319ae04561492df8f2", "content": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Product Updates", "Technical Writing"]}, "is_legacy": {"hash": "f8320b26d30ab433c5a54546d21f414c", "content": false}}
