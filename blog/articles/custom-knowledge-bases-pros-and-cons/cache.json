And it is much needed in today's swift corporate environment. To fill this need, custom knowledge bases are gaining popularity. Did you know that businesses with strong knowledge management and dissemination practices are [20% more productive](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/knowledge-management-secret-sauce-of-productivity) than their rivals? \n\nA personalized knowledge base may aid in productivity, cost reduction, and client satisfaction by making this information freely available to staff and consumers. We'll explore the pros and cons of custom knowledge bases in this post and discuss how they may benefit the future of your business. We will also talk about how Docsie fulfills the need for streamlined [documentation ](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/how-to-win-with-organized-and-automated-product-documentation/)for organizations.\n\n## What is a Custom Knowledge Base Software?\n\nTo put it simply, custom knowledge base software is a warehouse of information that has been designed specifically to meet the demands of your company. And you would be shocked to know that Up to[ 50% less support tickets](https://document360.com/blog/benefits-of-knowledge-base/) are likely to be expected from happy customers when using a well-maintained knowledge base. Unlike off-the-shelf programs, **custom knowledge base software** is developed from scratch to meet the requirements of a certain organization.\n\nWhy do they matter? Let's say you're in charge of a shipyard and want to provide your engineers with a reference that will help them navigate the many difficult steps involved in producing a ship. In contrast to ready-to-use software's broad approach, a custom knowledge base may walk you through your specific processes step by step.\n\n|Pros of Custom Knowledge Bases|Cons of Custom Knowledge Bases|\n|-|-|\n|Tailored to Your Needs|Development Time|\n|Scalability on Demand|Cost|\n|Full Data Control|Maintenance Challenges|\n|Enhanced Customer Experience|Learning Curve|\n|Integration with Existing Systems|Resource Intensive|\n|Advanced Analytics|Risk of Over-Complication|\n|Security|Initial Setup Complexity|\n|Support for Complex Workflows|Vendor Dependence|\n|Branding and Design Control|Lack of Immediate Solutions|\n|Highly Targeted Content|Incompatibility Issues|\n## Pros of Custom Knowledge Bases\n\n![Pros of Custom Knowledge Bases](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_HDbtgKoeQBYobiims/image5.jpg)\n\n### 1. Customization\n\nThe hallmark of custom knowledge bases is their unparalleled flexibility. You have the freedom to shape them precisely to your needs. For instance, if you're an e-commerce giant, you can design a knowledge base that adapts to your ever-changing product catalog, creating a seamless experience for your customers. For example, [Amazon's customized knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wisdom/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKnowledgeBase.html) constantly evolves to keep pace with its vast array of products and services.\n\n### 2. Scalability\n\nBusinesses grow, and so do their knowledge requirements. Unsurprisingly, a custom knowledge base can save businesses an average of[ $10,000 per year](https://www.proprofskb.com/blog/much-money-can-knowledge-base-save-business/). Custom solutions scale effortlessly with your organization, ensuring that your knowledge base keeps up with your expansion. For example, A startup can start with a basic custom knowledge base software and scale it as it grows into a multinational corporation.\n\n### 3. Data Control\n\nWith a custom knowledge base, you hold the reins to your data. This unrestricted access allows you to manage, update, and secure your information as you see fit. For example, Healthcare providers can ensure the utmost privacy of patient data within their custom knowledge base.\n\n### 4. Enhanced Customer Experience\n\n[Studies ](https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/07/real-time-response-to-customers.html)have shown that 82% of customers expect immediate access to information. Custom knowledge base software allows you to provide real-time, relevant content, which leads to improved user satisfaction. For example, [Airbnb's custom knowledge base ](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2575)ensures travelers quickly find the perfect accommodations.\n\n### 5. Integration with Existing Systems\n\nCustom knowledge bases are not siloed systems. Instead, they work in harmony with your current programs and infrastructure. As a result, you can give your customers a uniform and unified experience across all media. Knowledge bases can be hooked up to other systems, like banking software so that customers always have the latest info. This could make customers happier and less annoyed.  \n\n### 6. In-Depth Analyses\n\nCustom knowledge bases do more than merely store facts and figures. Better business decisions may be made with the data they gather and evaluate. By monitoring their consumers' actions and preferences, stores may better target their advertising. \n\n### 7. Security\n\nCompanies lose billions of dollars annually due to security breaches in their data. For the protection of private data, custom solution providers offer a greater level of security. Custom knowledge bases, for instance, are used by government organizations to protect sensitive information. Custom knowledge bases can be adapted to the specific sorts of data that need to be safeguarded and are created to match the organization's unique demands. \n\n### 8. Help with Complicated Processes\n\nWorkflows are as unique as the companies that use them. Custom knowledge base software may be made to fit your organization's unique needs for efficiency. Custom knowledge bases can be used by manufacturing organizations to improve their production processes, for instance.\n\n### 9. Brand Management and Visual Direction\n\nThe quality of your body of information represents your company. Customization allows you to maintain brand integrity and design consistency for your user base. [Apple's support documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) greatly illustrates its attention to detail and ease of use.\n\n### 10. Super-Specific Information\n\nRelevance is paramount in the modern digital era. Thanks to custom knowledge bases, you may serve up highly targeted material that caters to the individual needs of various user groups. Customized information for kids, teachers, and school officials is one example.\n\n## Cons of Custom Knowledge Bases\n\n![Cons of Custom Knowledge Bases](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_6Y9oQq6GIdfGGnBES/image4.jpg)\n\n\n### 1. Development Time\n\nBuilding a custom knowledge base takes time and effort. It's not going to happen in a day. In order to find a solution that works for you, you must first identify what those needs are. It may take many months, for instance, to create a specialized knowledge base for a healthcare professional.\n\n### 2. High Cost\n\nCustomization comes at a high price. It might be expensive to create and manage your own database of information. For instance, a tailored solution may be out of reach financially for a small organization.\n\n### 3. Maintenance Challenges\n\nCustom solutions, in contrast to pre-packaged software, require regular upkeep to ensure they are always up to date and safe. By way of illustration, tech firms' custom knowledge bases need constant updates to fend off new dangers.\n\n### 4. Learning Curve\n\nEmployees may need some time to adjust to a new, bespoke system. The pace of integration may be slowed as a result. For instance, new users may need training when they go from pre-packaged software to a tailored solution.\n\n### 5. Resource Intensive\n\nCustom solution implementations need a commitment of time, effort, and technical know-how. Companies in the manufacturing sector, for instance, require qualified personnel to oversee their exclusive knowledge base.\n\n### 6. Risk of Over-Complication\n\nIn the pursuit of customization, there's a risk of making the system overly complex, which can lead to inefficiency. For example, Complex custom knowledge bases confuse users rather than help them.\n\n### 7. Initial Setup Complexity\n\nSetting up a custom knowledge base can be tough, especially if you've never done it before. Startups, for example, might have trouble with the initial documentation and setup of a custom solution.\n\n### 8. Vendor Dependence\n\nCustom solutions often entail dependence on specific vendors for development and support. For example, Enterprises may rely heavily on a software development company for their custom knowledge base.\n\n### 9. Lack of Immediate Solutions\n\nUnlike ready-to-use software that provides instant solutions, custom development takes time to implement, delaying immediate benefits. For example, A retail business might not see immediate improvements after starting the custom knowledge base development process.\n\n### 10. Incompatibility Issues\n\nCustom solutions can sometimes clash with other software in your organization, which can cause problems. For example, it can be tricky to integrate a custom knowledge base with legacy systems.\n\n## Ready -to- use vs. Custom: Which is Right for You?\n\n![Ready -to- use vs. Custom: Which is Right for You?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_TaFf0sqs8JssLLVap/image1.jpg)\n\n\nOkay, now that we've looked at the pros and cons of custom knowledge bases, it's time to answer the big question: which one is right for your organization?
