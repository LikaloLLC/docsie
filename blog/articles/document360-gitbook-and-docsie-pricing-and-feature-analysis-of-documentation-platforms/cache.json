This feature allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, promoting collaboration and facilitating real-time updates.\n\n  \n\nWith collaborative editing, teams can collaborate seamlessly, making edits, adding comments, and discussing changes in real-time. This ensures efficient teamwork and helps maintain accuracy and consistency in the documentation.\n\n  \n\n2.  #### Version Control:\n    \n\nVersion control is crucial for documentation platforms; all three platforms excel in this area.

The ability to customise the documentation platform ensures a consistent and cohesive brand experience for users and reinforces the organisation's identity.\n\n  \n\n5.  #### Analytics and Insights:\n    \n\nAnalytics and insights provide valuable data and metrics to assess the performance and effectiveness of documentation. Document360 offers robust analytics capabilities, providing comprehensive insights into user engagement, document usage, and performance metrics.\n\n  \n\nGitbook provides basic analytics functionality, offering a basic level of data to understand user interactions and document metrics.\n\n  \n\nDocsie offers analytics capabilities, although the specific extent and depth of analytics may vary. Analytics and insights enable organisations to identify areas of improvement, optimise content, and make data-driven decisions to enhance their documentation processes.\n\n  \n\nBy carefully considering the features offered by each platform, organisations can evaluate which platform aligns best with their specific documentation needs.
