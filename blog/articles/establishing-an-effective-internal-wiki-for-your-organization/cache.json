In this  article, we will discuss how  wikis  are developed, their uses, and why they are important to your organization.\n\n\n\n## What is an  internal wiki, and why do you need one for your business?\n\n###  Internal Wikis - Your Company's Knowledge Hub\n\nAn internal wiki is a centralized platform for storing, finding, and sharing crucial company information.\n\n**Key benefits:**\n- Eliminates redundant queries\n- Protects against knowledge loss\n- Improves organizational culture\n\n**Essential features to look for:**\n- Seamless integration with existing tools\n- Robust search functionality\n- Collaboration capabilities\n- Version control and content management\n\n**Best practices for implementation:**\n- Effective organization and clear structure\n- Regular updates and maintenance\n- Proper access controls and user training\n\nChoose between self-hosted or cloud-based solutions based on your company's needs and resources.\n\n*Discover how to create, organize, and launch an internal wiki to boost your team's productivity and knowledge sharing.*\n \n![What is an  internal wiki,](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_GJsWZd9629Xpu5d7k/ce5e5b39-8d07-cd5b-0eb6-4898b760dc86what_is_an_internal_wiki__and_why_do_you_need_one_for_your_business.png)\n\nA company's  internal  wiki  is a dedicated location where  teams  may store, locate, and exchange vital  information  with each other. Consider it as your organization's long-term memory or internal  knowledge  repository.  Businesses  utilize  wikis  to record vital  information  for their  company  operations,  Information  such as corporate policies, procedures, processes, technical notes(release notes and other story descriptions), project plans, and training and onboarding documentation.\n\nA  corporate  wiki  eliminates redundant queries and enables your staff to operate independently. Additionally, it safeguards your business against attrition -  wikis  save  information  that might otherwise be lost.\n\nAdditionally,  wikis  have a beneficial effect on organizational culture.  Employees  are compelled to improve their writing skills \u2013 to communicate their point simply and succinctly. By writing more clearly, you can think more clearly, which enhances teamwork and productivity.\n\n## What are key features in a  wiki  creation platform that you should look for when choosing one to support your companies'  internal  wiki  needs?\n\n\n  \n![key features in a  wiki  creation platform](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_hk3Mzpy1tkqVzNgqc/3e2b47e6-eccc-39f6-00bc-df59744e852ekey_features_in_a_wiki_creation.png)\n  \n\nYour firm will tailor your  wiki  experience to your specific requirements. However, the following elements are critical to your  wiki  experience. When selecting an  internal  wiki  for your organization, ensure that it provides these characteristics.\n\n### Your  wiki  should integrate seamlessly with the technologies that your  team  currently utilizes.\n\nYour  team  already communicates and shares  information  using platforms such as Github Gist, Air table as well as  document  editors such as Google Sheets. As a consequence, your collective  knowledge  is dispersed throughout a small number of applications. Your staff must continually switch  tools  in order to have access to critical corporate  information.\n\nWhile an  internal  wiki  may assist, the fact is that some of your team's vital  knowledge  will continue to reside inside the constraints of technologies other than your  wiki. This is why having a  wiki  creator that can integrate with your company's technologies is essential when choosing the right  wiki  for your organization.\n\n### The search tool should be sturdy and effective.\n\nA robust search tool (which is what we  use  at Docsie) enables  users  to quickly locate material without having to go through folders or topics.\n\nAt the very least, the  search functionality of the  company wiki  should be as quick and straightforward as Google's.\n\nDocsie\u2019s search allows our  users  to find  content  and  knowledge  quickly and efficiently. By typing in the word they are looking for, all of the articles and their locations will appear, which is one of the  best practices  to follow.\n\nConsider the search feature in Docsie to help  users  find resources from  company knowledge. Docsie enables  teams  to centrally store, organize, and distribute vital  information  on  internal company wiki. They depend on our platform to assist them in quickly locating what they're searching for. That is why, when you click the search box in Docsie, we display your most recently read posts \u2013 since the  article  you're looking for is certainly one you've just visited.\n\nAdditionally, we provide faceted search, which helps you to refine your search. **For instance**, this is how you might locate references to the word '**Javascript**' inside your documentation and various articles:\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955005-1700146955005.jpeg)\n\nA quick and powerful search function is not only a means of reducing the time spent on the quest for  information. Additionally, it provides a great  user  experience for your  team, increasing their likelihood to utilize and adding excellent functionality to your Docsie  wiki. You can also set up  private  wiki  as well as decide who can have  access rights  to ensure the safety and security of your data and  knowledge management. For instance, you may not want to share access to  new hires  during their probation period, post which you can add them to your  team wiki  or continue limiting them to platforms like  Google Drive.\n\n### The ability to collaborate\n\nInternal  wikis  eliminate the  knowledge  silos that naturally exist in every organization with numerous  teams. However,  teams  should retain their own dedicated place for  company information  on your  wiki.\n\nTeams  do this via the usage of books within shelves with Docsie (other wikis-type folders). Engineering  teams, for  example, have their own devoted subject for  important  information, as does Marketing. Additionally, each  team  in an  entire organization  may develop nested subtopics. For instance, each of your Brand and Growth  teams  may have its own dedicated subtopic inside the Marketing subject.\n\nWhatever these specialized venues are named, they should make it simple to get the appropriate  information  in front of the right  people, at the right time.\n\nDocsie allows for seamless collaboration with your  team. Here is a video that demonstates a few collaboration features within Docsie.\n\n[![Watch the video](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955029-1700146955029.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEEihQh0UKM)Also, Docsie, unlike  Google Docs  or  others, allows you to set various roles within the platform which is important to stipulate who can do what and to what capacity can they do it, making it  user-friendly.\n\nHere is an  example  of how we positioned the roles of our  users  within Docsie:\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955085-1700146955085.jpeg)\n\nCollaboration is extremely important, especially in these times, where most  teams  work  remotely.

Look for a  wiki  that prominently displays critical  information  such as the date and author of a post to find  new content.\n\nWho last modified the  content  of your  wiki?\n\nIf you also have a  question  like how last modified your documentation, then having a platform that shows timestamps is key! Docsie allows all of our  users  to see what has been done within various books and this helps them understand what  work  is still required to be completed in  best way  possible.\n\n  \n\n## What are the key necessities for a well organized  internal  wiki  platform?\n\n  \nCreating an efficient  internal  wiki  platform requires careful consideration of several key factors. From effective organization to keeping the format easy to read, the success of such a platform hinges on its ability to serve as a centralized hub for  information. Let's delve into the essential components that contribute to a well-organized  internal  wiki  platform.\n\n### Effective organization\n\nTo store and organize material,  document  editors make  use  of the conventional folder, also they can have articles and sub-articles, headings, and various layout configurations that can help to manage the layout of your  internal  wiki  a lot more efficiently. However, most of the time finding these files and knowing which file belongs to which department can be tedious without the proper organization of documentation. This makes it difficult for colleagues to locate and keep  information.\n\nHaving search capabilities within the platform allows for different  teams  and departmental associates to find the appropriate documentation quickly and effectively. Also having the  information  divided into books and shelves creates a more organized situation for the organization's  internal documentation.\n\nHere is an  example  of Docsie's workspace. As you can see we have already organized our documentation within books and shelves. The books are articles and the shelves are a collection of different articles within a specifically tailored  knowledge  portal.\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955256-1700146955256.jpeg)\n\n### Keeping the format consistent and easy to read\n\nDocumentation should be simple and uncomplicated. With additional formatting choices available to your  team, the documentation experience becomes more onerous. When everyone is free to structure their posts whatever they like, the result is an uneven and perplexing  wiki  experience. If you have a simple to read format that is easy to follow, not only will it be easy to develop and maintain but it will be a quicker and more effective  process  in developing documentation within a simple structure that is the same design all across the board.\n\nHere is an  example  of a  user  guide developed by Docsie. It is our help portal and it will help you understand what a useful and dynamic format looks like.\n\n1.  **The main writing area:**  It\u2019s a  good idea  to have images and diagrams, as well as the write-up to best, explain your documentation. It's in a nice location and sized well with headers and titles, positioned well.\n2.  **Fully functional search navigation:** This is extremely important in order to speed up the  process  in which your readers find suitable  information\n3.  **Links:**  Links are key to directing your readers to other  pages  that are necessary for them to review.\n4.  **Table of  contents:**  This allows your readers to pinpoint specific articles within your  knowledge  portal and  internal documentation.\n5.  **Language and version picker:**  The ability for your readers to change languages is crucial for  companies  that have a lot of  employees  that  work  overseas, within different countries.\n\n### Search is not just a passing idea\n\nWhen you have a limited amount of documentation written and a small number of  employees  it may not be problematic to find the right  information  quickly. However, as your  team  grows and more individuals contribute to your  internal  knowledge base, you'll become aware of these  document  editors' limits.\n\nMost  internal documentation  is not meant for a growing  internal  wiki  with many  employees. To have a dynamic search engine along with a well-organized  wiki  is essential for maintaining a smooth workflow on finding useful  information, policies,  user  guides, and tutorials that the  employees  need while searching through the documentation.\n\n## Self-hosting or cloud-based  wikis, which one is better for your organization?\n\nNow let's talk about how to publish your documentation, is it better to have a self-hosted or cloud-based proprietary  wiki?\n\nLet's begin by looking at the pros and cons for each alternative.\n\n### Wiki  that is self-hosted\n\nIf you have the cash and resources, you may host your  corporate  wiki  on your intranet, server, or  [internet hosting provider](https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/). Among the advantages of a self-hosted  wiki  are the following:\n\n-   You are the only owner of your data.\n-   You may design a  wiki  experience that is tailored to your individual requirements and specifications.\n\nHowever, a self-hosted  wiki  consumes significant technical resources. Typically, it is best suited for  teams  with very specialized requirements.\n\n### Wiki  hosted on the cloud\n\nDocsie, **for  example**, enables you to create an  internal  wiki  without devoting significant technical resources. Within one business day, you can be up and running.\n\nIt will be easy to manage and  work  with. Also, it can easily be embedded within your  companies  website with one line of code, this will make it seamlessly merge with your company's brand's look and feel for an overall comfortable  user  experience. In a long term using Docsie to help you host your documentation through our portal or embedded Docsie  pages  on your  companies  site will save time and money in the long run, and lead to a more sufficient documentation workflow.\n\n  \n\n## Kinds of  Wiki\n\nWikis  come in different kinds, each customized to various purposes and needs. Here are a few ones:\n\n1.  **Enterprise  Wiki:** Intended for  use  inside an association, these  wikis  center around coordinated effort and  information  dividing between workers. They frequently incorporate elements, for  example,  access control  and combination with other venture frameworks.\n2.  **Public  Wiki****:** Open to the general population, these  wikis  permit anybody to see and alter  content. Wikipedia is a perfect representation of a  public  wiki  where clients overall add to an immense range of points.\n3.  **Confidential  Wiki:** Limited to a particular gathering or association,  private  wikis  give a controlled climate to joint effort and data dividing between a characterized set of clients. They are frequently utilized for inner documentation and  information  the board.\n4.  **Educational  Wiki:** Outfitted towards supporting educational exercises, these  wikis  are utilized in scholastic settings. They  work  with cooperative learning,  information  sharing, and class project coordination among understudies and teachers.\n5.  **Project  Wiki:** Zeroed in on a particular venture or undertaking, these  wikis  act as a concentrated space for project documentation, task following, and joint effort among colleagues. They assist with smoothing out correspondence and guarantee that everybody in  question  is in total agreement.\n6.  **Personal  Wiki:** Made for individual  use, individual  wikis  go about as a computerized scratch pad or  information  storehouse for individual data, thoughts, and notes. They can be a valuable device for putting together considerations and data.\n7.  **Software Documentation  Wiki:** Frequently utilized by programming improvement groups, these  wikis  give a stage to reporting code, APIs, and improvement processes. They support joint effort among designers and assist with keeping a thorough record of programming related data.\n\n## Laying the groundwork for your  information  architecture\n\nThe appearance of your  information  structure will be determined in large part by the  wiki  solution you pick.\n\nIn Docsie, the material is organized in three ways: shelves (which function similarly to folders) and books (which house the  content  itself). Thus, if your  team  makes  use  of Docsie, your  information  architecture  refers to the way your subjects are organized.\n\n### As you organize your team's  internal  wiki:\n\nConcentrate on clarity. Everyone on your  team, not just those who created it, should be able to simply explore your  wiki. Utilize many pairs of eyes to ensure that your  wiki  structure makes sense widely and that everyone understands where to get  information.\n\nAllow  teams  to be flexible. Allow each  team  to create a subject or folder in the manner that makes the most sense for their workflow. A framework that works for one  team  may not  work  for another.\n\n### Import and supplement  content\n\nAfter you've established your architecture, you may begin adding material to your  internal  wiki. If you already have documentation (for  example, on DocX, Markdown PDF and/or JSON files), you should import it into your new  wiki  before it goes live. We make it simple to import material from a number of  tools, as well as markdown files into Docsie.\n\nAdditionally, you should include any significant new material into your  wiki  prior to its formal debut. Several items that  teams  commonly add when launching their  corporate  wiki  are their  employee  handbook and a tutorial on how to navigate their new  wiki  or  knowledge base.\n\n**Configure integrations**\n\nAs indicated before, your  team  is likely to rely on a small number of technologies to hold critical data. Rather than replacing these  tools, we've discovered that integrating them with your  knowledge base  benefits  your  team  more.\n\nConsider which material should be stored in your  wiki  and which should be linked to it. Certain types of material belong in a tool other than your  wiki. For instance, engineering  teams  that utilize GitHub may  use  Docsie to sync markdown files and include bugs and pull requests from GitHub. Thus,  users  may continue to  use  GitHub for their workflow while adding effortlessly to their company's  wiki.\n\nDocsie allows our  users  to integrate various other SaaS solutions within our platform.

Group related topics together, and establish a clear taxonomy that aligns with the organization's structure.\n    \n2.  **Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search feature to empower  users  to quickly locate  specific information. A reliable search engine can significantly enhance the  user  experience and efficiency.\n    \n3.  **Regular Updates**: Focus on continuous improvement via regular updates as outdated  information  can lead to confusion.\n    \n4.  **Permission Controls**: Create proper access levels because you don't need to provide access to all  information  to everyone.  \n      \n      \n5.   **Collaborative Editing**: Facilitate collaborative  content creation  and editing. Encourage  team members  to contribute their expertise, fostering a sense of ownership and ensuring that  information  remains up-to-date and accurate.  \n    \n6.  **Version Control**: Implement  version control  mechanisms to track changes made to documents. This not only provides a history of edits but also allows for easy rollbacks in case of errors or misinformation.\n    \n7.  **User  Training and Documentation**: Offer comprehensive training and documentation for  users. This ensures that everyone understands how to navigate the  internal  wiki  platform effectively and contributes to its success.\n    \n\n## Create a launch plan\n\nYou may now begin planning your launch. You'll need to make a critical decision: will the first rollout be limited to a  single  team  or will it span the whole organization?\n\n  \n![Create a launch plan](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_7YAL4VSGWRE1CfMOd/68851456-3d33-f0ba-ac37-0eb5d512ca53create_a_launch_plan.png)\n\n**Team-specific:** If you want to open your  wiki  to a  single  team, that  team  will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the product and begin developing their own  information  architecture. Then, as your  internal  wiki  grows, the initial staff may give invaluable insight and assistance.\n\n**Company-wide:** If you choose to deploy your  wiki  throughout your whole organization at once, ensure that everyone is aware of the procedure for managing your authorized  knowledge base. Otherwise, it is recommended that you begin with a  single  team  and then expand to departments and expand even further. For company-wide rollouts, we advocate hiring  team  ambassadors. They will develop into product specialists and will be able to lead the charge within their respective  teams.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\n  \n\nYour organization's  internal  wiki  is more than a repository for vacation policy. Your  wiki  contributes to the development of a culture of writing and  information  sharing.\n\nHowever, the  wiki  you select is significant. Choose a  wiki  that simplifies and streamlines documentation. Nobody should be required to jump through hoops in order to have a good grasp of the  knowledge  you are sharing. This is why we suggest that having a well-thought-out  internal  wiki  is a  great way  to  share information  in a strategic and methodological manner in order to help maintain strong  company  morale."}, "summary": {"hash": "b91ae5ff5301edfff630c0401dd7b2db", "content": "How to pick, organize, and launch an internal wiki for your business.
