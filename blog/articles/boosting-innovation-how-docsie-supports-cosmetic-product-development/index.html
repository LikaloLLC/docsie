<p>Effective documentation management is essential for the seamless development and compliance of cosmetic products. However, many teams encounter significant challenges that can lead to delays, regulatory risks, and inefficiencies. Addressing these hurdles is critical to maintaining product integrity, meeting compliance requirements, and ensuring smooth collaboration across departments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Version Control Issues: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date product documentation is vital to avoid miscommunication and costly errors. Common version control challenges include:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Tracking Product Iterations: Cosmetic formulations undergo multiple modifications before final approval, making it crucial to maintain well-documented records. Challenges in tracking product iterations include:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining structured records of formulation changes, stability test results, and product performance feedback to support decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding data silos, where information is stored in isolated systems, making it difficult to track historical product modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring audit-ready documentation that provides clear visibility into product development history for both internal reviews and regulatory inspections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
