We compared the tools in eight areas that users talk about the most:\n\n* Pricing\n\n* Support\n\n* Automation\n\n* Integrations\n\n* Ease of use\n\n* Database features\n\n* Documentation features\n\n* And knowledge management\n\n**Let me save you some time\u2026 If you\u2019re looking for an easy-to-learn knowledge management app, check out Doc[sie. I](https://www.docsie.io/)t\u2019s free for up to 3 users, and unlimited guests can view the data!***\n\n## Comparison Summary: Coda vs Notion vs Docsie\n\n![Comparison Summary: Coda vs Notion vs Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Gbzf0Ht5p4WkGyDEu/60d26fd0-6fa7-6315-b28c-77bb52071fcdimage.png)\n\n## Docsie vs Coda vs Notion: Documentation Features\n\n**Docsie is best for creating documents, and Notion leads Coda with its editor**\n\n![Docsie ](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_6jS1lrlw2jakRtTSS/7a1e10d0-7ff4-3e9a-c8a8-e95fe8681bb6image.png)\n\n**Notion and Coda use \"blocks\" while Docsie is more intuitive**\n\nNotion and Coda both have editing features that rely on building blocks, which allow you to add headers, images, videos, text, etc.\n\n![Notion and Coda ](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_K8EhYKmEzzXLlzyED/464be919-c7e6-ee02-2712-4199de0eb4fc4.png)\n\nThe difference is that Coda starts working slowly when dealing with large documents. And Notion flows more naturally when writing since it started as a note-taking tool.\n\nMeanwhile, Docsie is more like a WordPress editor \u2014 with a more intuitive user experience. Like Notion and Coda, it also gives you all the editing functionality you need but focuses more on ease of use with features like shortcuts.\n\n![WordPress editor](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_QLNiJSTmyFVr34Hpw/dcb6f484-1df4-27ca-62c4-bb02c74f4f525.png)\n\n**Docsie has the best sharing & client access**\n\nNotion and Coda both let you manage access internally by assigning roles with admin tools, or externally by sharing them on the internet.\n\nDocsie uses a similar system but also lets you password-protect pages and share articles with readers on knowledge portals or website embeds.\n\n**Coda has minimal version control, Notion shows change history, and Docsie has rollback and access permissions**\n\nCoda offers minimal version control, which can\u2019t help with questions like \"when was the last time this page changed?\" or \"what changed?\"\n\nNotion provides change history with the enterprise plan, but it allows only rollbacks, so it works more like a backup than actual version control.\n\nMeanwhile, **Docsie has powerful version control features.**\n\nInstead of rollbacks, all of your previous article versions are available in the book. You can designate one as the \u201ccurrent version\u201d and decide if you want to show old versions to users. That means you have complete control of what you show to your readers and how you version your documents.\n\n**Docsie has powerful content embeds**\n\nAnother difference between Coda, Notion, and Docsie is that Docsie allows [19 content embeds](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/docsie-integrations/?doc=/content-embeds/google-forms-in-docsie/&v=2.0.0&ln=en) that work seamlessly in your articles. That means you can use the full functionality of apps like Google Sheets, Google Docs, Loom, Google Maps, GitHub Gists, and many more.\n\n**Winner:** [**Docsie**](https://www.docsie.io/). It\u2019s the perfect blend of features and ease of use to create beautiful digital documentation.\n\n![Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ijClMNPejkT6AcQlq/3cff1420-b57a-6a94-c90f-d718f52f61856.png)\n\n## Notion vs Coda vs Docsie: Knowledge Management\n\n**Docsie has all you need in one package, Notion and Coda are customizable but can get complex**\n\n**Docsie has an intuitive organization structure, while Coda and Notion let you create your own**\n\n![Coda and Notion](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_WRgZM09XbYbBphN3g/b1cb0869-6f67-3a9e-0d4d-833833ed56faimage.png)\n\nDocsie uses an intuitive knowledge organization structure.\n\nIt uses \u201cshelves\u201d that contain \u201cbooks\u201d, which can be organized into \u201csections\u201d. The books contain articles, previous versions, and articles in other languages.\n\n**Docsie works just like a library, and it\u2019s easy to understand.**\n\n\n![Docsie 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_taaK2xC3oGVlfbB6u/d5272e81-1fcf-649b-0943-f68f125596407.png)\n\nCoda and Notion, on the other hand, rely on nested pages. It\u2019s intuitive and you can create any structure you want. But it can get confusing quickly if you\u2019re nesting subpages more than 3 layers deep.\n\n**Coda\u2019s search is clunky, Docsie and Notion easily surface the right information**\n\nLarge organizations often have problems finding data in Coda. Its search isn\u2019t as advanced as Notion\u2019s or Docsie\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t surface pages as results, only data.\n\nMeanwhile, Notion and Docsie are more user-friendly because they search across pages and all data. Docsie also lets you filter articles by language.\n\n**Winner:** **Do[csie**](https://www.docsie.io/), since it uses a very intuitive & scalable organization structure and a powerful search that lets you navigate your documents quickly.\n\n## Notion vs Docsie vs Coda: Pricing & Value for money\n\n**Notion offers best value for money, Docsie is most affordable for knowledge management, Coda is pricey**\n\n![Docsie being affordable for knowledge management](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ToSMUdd9b8bQxXq6O/769d7d69-0a9d-1c93-23d3-d2824a986423image.png)\n\n### Free plan comparison\n\n**Coda** offers a free plan for an unlimited number of team members. The number of table rows is limited to 1000 across all your tables. The number of objects in the doc is also limited to 50. Objects include pages, tables, views, buttons, controls, and Formulas. So if you want to manage a team with Coda, you\u2019ll quickly exceed the free pricing plan limits.\n\n**Notion**\u2019s free plan doesn\u2019t limit the number of blocks you can use, but it\u2019s made for only one person. You can add 5 guests, but you can\u2019t manage access for them.\n\n**Docsie** has a free plan for up to 3 accounts and you get to show your documents to unlimited guests. But it has a file upload limit and you can manage 5 books and 1 shelf (though with unlimited articles).\n\n### Paid plan price comparison\n\n**On the paid plan, every app lets you share documents with guests for free.** So prices essentially depend on how many team members have editing access.\n\n[**Coda**](https://coda.io/pricing) charges $10/month/user for the \u201cPro\u201d and $30/month/user for the \u201cTeam\u201d plan.\n\n[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/pricing) charges $4/month/user for the \u201cPersonal Pro\u201d and $8/month/user for the \u201cTeam\u201d plan.\n\n[**Docsie**](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/) has three flat-fee pricing plans based on team size and features.\n\n\n![Personal Pro](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_c5RDZVCv35TAPYDrP/7d646eed-dd46-d9ca-3fb2-3edac01eaefcimage.png)\n\n**What to go with if the price is your biggest concern**\n\n**Go with Notion if:**\n\n* You\u2019re only looking for a free personal productivity platform. (Free plan)\n\n* You want to provide your team with powerful personal workspaces, but don\u2019t need strong collaboration tools. (Personal Pro plan)\n\n* You need an all-in-one workspace with over 25 members (Team plan)\n\n**Go with Docsie if:**\n\n* You need a collaborative platform with up to 15 editors (Startup Plus/Small Team plans)\n\n* You\u2019re a team of any size that needs a specialized app for knowledge base/SOP management \u2014 Docsie isn\u2019t much more expensive than Notion but it has better features for these use cases\n\n**Go with Coda if:**\n\n* You need a team workspace with more database/automation features than Notion\n\n* The lack of key knowledge base management features and high price aren\u2019t problems for you\n\n**Winner**: Either **Do[csie**](https://www.docsie.io/) or **No[tion**](https://www.notion.so/). If you need a dedicated SOP knowledge base, go with Docsie. If you need a general productivity workspace, go with Notion.\n\n## Coda vs Docsie vs Notion: Customer Support\n\n**Coda and Docsie have the best customer support, while Notion is still catching up**\n\n![Coda and Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_cCccYMWpvSFtStVar/5515627e-1c86-1910-d840-530861b6e3e1image.png)\n\nCustomer support is tough to judge.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to base it on a single experience. So we\u2019ve gone over the latest reviews and opinions on Reddit, G2, and Capterra to compare the three based on what users say.\n\n**Notion\u2019s customer support is still catching up**\n\nNotion used to rely on its community for support.\n\nIt only started investing in a proper support team recently. Users say their support doesn\u2019t provide good technical help, and quickly sends you to engineers for such issues. And engineers usually say they\u2019ll fix it in the next version.\n\n![Coda and Docsie Image 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Zc6no9VdccJBm78Q1/badb84b7-f421-feec-f6a5-b0cc60e4e4518.jpg)\n\n![Coda and Docsie Image 2](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_arYfHgXKSqyItecO9/70a571c4-f7d4-ba02-a41d-df9dba82f4dd9.jpg)\n\n**Coda has great customer support**\n\n[Many Coda users](https://www.g2.com/products/coda-coda/reviews?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters%5Bkeyphrases%5D=support%20team&order=g2_default&filters%5Bcomment_answer_values%5D=) praise their support team for the fast response times and how easy it is to work with.\n\n![Coda 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_L3h5NDTOx7T4H6yKS/6ebda287-cbc3-357a-728a-ffdb0fdbe03410.jpg)\n\n![Coda 2](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_PyDZVl8IRsMaZMyXx/b4a516c7-f699-5f32-9009-b49b283b5dee11.jpg)\n\n**Docsie\u2019s customer support is \u201cprofessional, responsive and well organized\u201d**\n\nOur team is always ready to help if you encounter any issues with Docsie. But it\u2019s best if you take it directly [from our users](https://www.g2.com/products/docsie/reviews?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters%5Bcomment_answer_values%5D=&filters%5Bkeyphrases%5D=customer%20support&order=g2_default):\n\n![Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_wt0iJ06KpLkaATys9/1dca9037-f99a-b339-f84d-e16f1f9b30be12.jpg)\n\n![Docsie 2](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_gOfQNDuAopOXxJZmO/596dc7e8-2dca-8115-5794-3ec872d923d113.jpg)\n\n**Winner:** [Coda](https://coda.io/) and [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/): for their quick (technical) support.\n\n## Coda vs Notion vs Docsie: Database Features\n**Coda is most powerful, Notion is for visualization, and Docsie allows you to embed Google Sheets**\n\n![Docsie-Coda](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_13TNnIbQ7OYsubsAI/54dd4e37-3864-a62f-2859-fefca1ed835eimage.png)\n\n**Notion is the king of visualization\u2026**\n\nNotion\u2019s table capabilities are extensive. You can create different \u201cviews\u201d like\n\n* List,\n\n* Table,\n\n* Board,\n\n* Gallery,\n\n* Calendar,\n\n* And timeline.\n\nYou make them by creating a new page with the selected view. Then you can also embed them on other pages.\n\n**But Coda\u2019s functions are wa*y b*etter than Notion\u2019s**\n\nCoda has similar database features as Notion.\n\nBut it also has conditional formatting and calculations, making it as robust as Google Sheets.\n\n![Notion](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Lx9cKNSIm8lNlGA9H/1bebbbb3-8e7f-72d1-17aa-a06945e3edaf14.jpg)\n\nOn top of that Coda has integrated functions that remind of a true programming language. If you're tech-savvy, they'll feel intuitive and easy. And you can add them *anywhere*, not just in tables.\n\n![Coda Integration functions](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Voln5A5F6XDlzUZkl/76b858e2-6310-dffb-46c7-f0825f41e78415.jpg)\n\nFor example, here\u2019s something that\u2019s trivial to do in Coda but a huge pain in Notion: If I want to count the number of rows in a spreadsheet with Status matching \"TODO\".\n\nIn Coda, this is as trivial as creating a formula: =MyTable.CountIf(Status=\"TODO\"). In Notion, you would have to create a new related database, link elements together, add a rollup field containing label text then use a convoluted formula like length(replaceAll(replaceAll(prop(\"Status\"), \"TODO\", \"*\"), \"[\\^*]\", \"\"))).\n\n**Docsie lets you embed Google Sheets**\n\nDocsie allows the creation of spreadsheets much like Notion, but it doesn\u2019t allow as many different views in its editor, nor does it have powerful functions like Coda. However, the workaround is that Docise allows Google Sheets embeds, with their full functionality.\n\n**Winner:** **[Coda**](https://coda.io/) for power users that want to replace Google Sheets.\n\n## Notion vs Coda vs Docsie: Apps And Integrations\n\n**Coda offers more native integrations than Notion, Docsie focuses on knowledge base functionality**\n\n![Docsie Functionality](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_oMD9vlGvaPuY0cOtt/dd0aabe5-3e88-3177-8aa5-e89322d4f6f3image.png)\n\nCoda is the best option if you need integrations across many apps. It offers *o[ver 300 native integrations*](https://coda.io/gallery?page=11&filter=packs), making it impossible not to integrate with your tech stack. Notion, on the other hand, focuses only on the essentials with its [36 native integrations](https://www.notion.so/integrations/all).\n\n**Docsie Approaches App Integrations Differently Than Notion Or Coda**\n\nDocsie\u2019s motto is \u201cknowledge base functionality first\u201d allowing you to directly [embed other apps\u2019 content](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/docsie-integrations/?doc=/content-embeds/&v=2.0.0&ln=en) into your articles. For example, it allows you to edit Google Docs directly on your knowledge portals, without having to open another browser tab or app.\n\nDocsie also has native integration with **GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Zapier** \u2014 so it\u2019s easily integrable with your business processes.\n\n**Winner: [Coda**](https://coda.io/), because of the sheer quantity of native integrations.\n\n## Coda vs Notion vs Docsie: Pros & Cons\n\n### Coda Pros & Cons\n\n![Coda Pros & Cons](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Wl2GZ9HiSFPj4xQH7/dff98869-d4cc-b515-e962-c2e72e43e0f1image.png)\n\n### Notion Pros & Cons\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_XmsifVBPdY9YdnIOv/b1b93820-6ada-d03d-2c2e-1c33b7a3d64fimage.png)\n\n### Docsie Pros & Cons\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_q5oG4LBrLsHd3kY6o/fb42e323-3075-1bcd-c26d-33176ab38f5dimage.png)\n\n## Final Verdict: Notion vs Coda vs Docsie\n\n![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_kPBShLpDPmRI5Q2xy/2eadb3f0-af11-2e39-f274-4f628033b9edimage.png)\n\nGreat apps aren\u2019t great because they have a bunch of features.\n\nThey\u2019re all about solving a user need by hitting the sweet spot between usability and feature set.\n\n\n![Features](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_G1agSf4EZ0watMJ6A/385616a2-d341-0af2-14af-a4089452a1bb1.png)\n\n### Use Coda If:\n\n* You need to do many table operations\n\n* You want to use formulas for advanced calculations and automation\n\n* You\u2019re an enterprise or mid-sized team that needs a workspace for single-project tracking\n\n![Coda Usage](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_zW1zFUNRzvRS8I9fp/c45a4993-a65b-ecf6-8d96-a9a9fc5fd41f2.png)\n\n### Use Notion If:\n\n* You need a project management app for personal use or a productivity app\n\n* You need a good visual representation of your data and information\n\n* You\u2019re a solopreneur, a small, or mid-sized team in need of a workspace\n\n\n![Docsie Usage 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_up2m33igEV8JBw547/78a0be75-0e8a-e1a3-116d-df95c4d897123.png)\n\n## Use Docsie If:\n\n* You want to easily create beautiful & functional docs\n\n* You need an easy-to-manage collaborative knowledge base platform\n\n* You want to create SOPs, wikis, manuals, product documentation, and datasheets\n\n*Click [here ](https://www.docsie.io/)to try out Docsie today!*\n\n"}, "summary": {"hash": "3def0d20177af17b0093324cb9513df6", "content": "We've included Docsie in this comparison because it\u2019s a tool that shares functionalities with both Notion and Coda, but covers use cases where the two fall short: in creating robust knowledge bases and company wikis.\n"}, "categories": {"hash": "020aa7450c7f4dc16767374dbca4e821", "content": ["Product Documentation", "Product Management", "Documentation Portals", "Best Practices", "Technical Writing", "Product Documentation Tutorials"]}, "is_legacy": {"hash": "f8320b26d30ab433c5a54546d21f414c", "content": false}}
