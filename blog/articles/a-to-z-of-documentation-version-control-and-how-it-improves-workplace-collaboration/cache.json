I can feel your pain. \n\nDocumenting your content should be an easy process without any goof-ups. However, at times we face issues managing the documentation workflow. It not only kills your time but also hampers the collaboration in your team. You can repeal these mistakes by implementing documentation version control and change tracking. \n\nToday, global businesses operate from different corners of the world. Their workforce is distributed globally so the importance of team collaboration has multiplied manifold. Therefore, managing documents has become more important than ever to maintain efficiency and a steady workflow. Following documentation best practices can help you move a step closer to bringing more accuracy in the workplace. \n\nWith agile development, many companies are creating documentation software to enhance inter-team collaboration and help the organization move toward better efficiency. In this blog, we will help you understand the A to Z of documentation management and version control. So dig in to know everything about the basics of change tracking. \n\n## What is Version Control?\n\nVersion control gives you complete authority over a document. If a common document is being shared among multiple shareholders with editing rights, you can track the recent changes. It also allows you to recall specific versions according to your needs. It enhances documentation hygiene by making you follow documentation best practices. \n\n## Why is Version Control Needed in Documentation?\n\nVersion control in documentation helps you avoid confusion and saves time by giving you access to the latest version of the document. It improves team collaboration by improving the scope of communication among team members. As you have transparency on the doc version, you can easily track the changes made by each team member. This feature is especially beneficial for product managers, writers, and engineers working on the same product updates. Moreover, the collaboration tools give you an upper hand in identifying and resolving conflicts quickly. \n\nDocumentation tools like [Docsie come with team collaboration](https://site.docsie.io/documentation-collaboration-software) and project management functionality. You can manage your documents on the go with these kinds of collaboration tools. The centralized platform helps you create embeddable software documents that adapt according to the preferences, languages, and locations of your customers. \n\n|CTA: Adopt documentation best practices with Docsie!|\n|-|\n## Benefits of Document Sharing\n\nImagine yourself to be a product manager working closely with content writers. You and your team are trying to market the right features and make your customers understand your new offerings. Your team and the writers are using the same document to list down the features but the document does not have the option to check version history. In the absence of this feature, you and the writers may work on different versions of the same document. Think of how much time and effort you will lose in such a scenario. \n\nHaving documentation management software and following documentation best practices can help you avoid such problems. Here are a few benefits of using collaboration tools like Docsie.  \n\n### Accurate and reliable information\n\nData integrity is the top priority for organizations all over the world. Every organization wants the information that is passed among departments to be accurate and up-to-date. Therefore, the feature of viewing document history becomes important as it allows stakeholders to make changes and update everyone with relevant information. It also secures the everyday documentation process. Through change tracking, you can control accidental edits, improve accuracy, and ensure the reliability of the documents. \n\n### Low chances of error\n\nIn a recent [report published by M-Files](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/), it was concluded that 46% of respondents mentioned that it is time-consuming and challenging to findthe documents they need. Without document history tracking, you may make edits on the wrong documents and circulate the same in your organization. This may put your company at risk. Having collaboration tools that allow you to edit the latest version when document sharing reduces the chances of errors. It controls the chances of errors during content creation and brings every stakeholder on the same page before they want to send the document out to the public. Moreover, these tools help you follow the documentation best practices correctly. \n\n### Tracking history\n\nChange tracking in the documents is necessary when managing multiple versions of the documents. Using document history, you can see who is contributing what to the projects. Moreover, when the documents are shared with the internal and external teams, you can see the changes made by writers, product managers, third-party contractors, and other stakeholders. It reduces errors and gives you control to make the necessary changes without any disruption. \n\n### Document access control\n\nHistory tracking during document sharing also improves safety standards. It ensures that the workflow processes comply with the safety instructions followed in your specific industry of operation. As the risk of cybersecurity threats has increased, protecting sensitive information is a prerequisite for organizations across the globe. Using documents with version control can help organizations uptight their security by adding user authentication, password encryption, and access control. \n\n### Better workflows\n\nHistory tracking in documents helps in improving the workflows, therefore adding more to organizational efficiency and productivity. It makes it easier for different talent pools to collaborate and contribute to the same project. They can make inputs, review changes, and merge conflicts and confusions. You can also save time by avoiding the issues related to finding the right document version or rewriting an older version. \n\n### Compliance and regulatory benefits\n\nYou need to file the right documents for internal auditing and compliance & regulatory benefits. Version history tracking gives you the control to edit the right document and record the changes made over time. The documentation platform made through agile development takes care of data sensitivity, storage, and compliance. \n\n### Disaster recovery \n\nWhen working on computers and laptops, you might accidentally delete important files. Document sharing ensures that the files are not lost and can be restored with the updated version. It merges conflicts relating to data storage and security. \n\nDocument sharing and history tracking help you send reliable information across the organization.
