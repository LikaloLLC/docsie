Documentation is an integral part of the product development process. As the product moves from a proof of concept to a reality, explanatory documentation is essential for educating customers on how to use your product.

In other words, in this timeline, the gap between creating a stellar product and ensuring users can unlock its full potential often lies in the quality of documentation.

Many businesses grapple with the challenge of presenting information in a way that engages users, addresses their pain points, and provides comprehensive solutions. The result? Potential customers are left in the dark, existing users are frustrated, and missed growth opportunities.

### The World of Product Documentation

What is the product for, what does it do, and how do they do it? These are some basic questions to be answered before a stakeholder interacts with the product.

Product documentation refers to the set of documents that provide information about a product, its features, functionalities, and usage. Product documentation is further bifurcated into two - System Documentation and User Documentation. They are divided based on their target audience and the type of information to be shared.

Product documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for users, customers, and stakeholders to understand, implement, and troubleshoot the product.

**Let’s use Docsie as an example!**

Docsie is a product documentation platform. It allows users to create, edit, annotate, and publish documentation in an online knowledge portal. It’s as simple as logging in, creating a new Docsie Book, and typing your first piece of content!

### But Why Does an Impressive Product Documentation Matter?
  
![But Why Does an Impressive Product Documentation Matter?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_A9fC9xSGFm3EYNgyB/why_cec30b50-4c9a-ad25-54b7-17dd021b6366.png)

**1.  Adds value to the product** - A comprehensive product documentation goes beyond the basic usage, offering tips, best practices, and use cases, enabling users to derive maximum value from the product.
   
**2.  Builds customer confidence in the product** - Clear and well-structured documentation instills confidence in users by empowering them with the knowledge needed to effectively use the product.
    
**3.  Reduced Support Burden** - Product documentation serves as a self-help resource, allowing users to troubleshoot issues independently. By addressing common queries through documentation significantly reduces the need for users to seek external support.

**4.  Time and Resource Savings** - Well-crafted documentation saves users time by offering quick access to information. Knowledge transfer is made seamless and quicker. Instead of spending valuable time searching for answers or waiting for support, users can efficiently resolve issues on their own.

**5.  Feature Exploration and Adaptability to Updates** - Documentation serves as a guide for users to explore and understand the full spectrum of product features. Additionally, it ensures users can smoothly adapt to updates and changes by providing clear information about new functionalities, improvements, or modifications.
    
**6.  Continuous improvement** - The practice of effective documentation includes mechanisms for user feedback and engagement. Valuable insights from users, help companies identify areas for improvement, address pain points, and enhance both the product and its accompanying documentation iteratively.
  
Hence from an easy-to-use interface to complex features and functions, Docsie helps you prepare more comprehensive explanations to drive the concept home for the stakeholders.

## 10 Amazing Product Documentation Examples 
Below, you will find 10 amazing product documentation examples selected by the Docsie team. We will explore how to replicate features and functions, and create similarly amazing documentation of your own in Docsie! 

### 1 - Docker 
Docker is a container virtualization platform that enables software hosting within tiny, modular and individually isolated IT environments. The concept allows for multiple disparate services to be hosted on a single host operating system by splitting and sharing operating system resources between containers. >[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) 
![Docker Documentation Portal Homepage](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/oywtjgyzfpsynkqslptj "Docker Documentation Portal Homepage") 
Docker has a formatted product documentation portal and presents all the essential information needed to download, install, and get up and running with Docker containers. It also shares multi-lingual product documentation, API reference documentation, and a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section at the bottom. For visual learners, there is also a video section in the bottom right.

To create a Getting Started section, let’s use Docsie as an example. To start in Docsie, you must create an account, confirm your email address, load the Docsie Workspace dashboard, create a new Shelf, and create a new Book – that’s the basics done! Create a framework of header titles for each section, write instructions, add pictures and hyperlinks and you will end up with a similar structure to below!

![Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ohzwitemzfuhcekepxex "Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation") 

**The best part? Docsie does this for you automatically!**
