An investigation by[ ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy)[McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy) demonstrated that knowledge workers spend approximately 1.8 weeks per year hunting and recovering information.

A survey reported that[ ](https://investor.manpowergroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/talent-shortages-record-high-45-employers-around-world-report)[45 percent](https://investor.manpowergroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/talent-shortages-record-high-45-employers-around-world-report) of employees claimed they have difficulty finding the information they need to perform their job well.
