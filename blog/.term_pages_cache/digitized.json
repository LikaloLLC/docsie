    "quick_definition": "Digitized refers to the process of converting physical documents or analog information into digital format for electronic storage and management. This transformation enables documentation teams to create searchable, accessible, and centrally managed digital archives from paper-based materials.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Digitization is the foundational process that transforms physical documents into digital assets, enabling modern documentation workflows and accessibility. For documentation professionals, this process represents the critical first step in creating comprehensive digital knowledge bases from existing paper archives.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for text extraction</li><li>Multiple format support including PDF, DOCX, and image files</li><li>Metadata tagging and indexing capabilities</li><li>Quality control and verification processes</li><li>Batch processing for large document volumes</li><li>Version control and audit trails</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enhanced searchability across entire document collections</li><li>Remote access and collaboration capabilities</li><li>Reduced physical storage requirements and costs</li><li>Improved document preservation and backup security</li><li>Integration with modern documentation management systems</li><li>Faster retrieval and distribution of information</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Digitization is the same as digitalization (process transformation)</li><li>All digitized documents are automatically searchable without OCR</li><li>Scanning equals complete digitization without quality control</li><li>Digital formats eliminate the need for backup strategies</li></ul>",
