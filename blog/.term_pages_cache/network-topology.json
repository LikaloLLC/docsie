    "quick_definition": "Network topology refers to the physical and logical arrangement of network components and their interconnections within a system. It defines how different network elements communicate with each other and describes the structure of data flow between nodes, devices, and systems.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Network topology is the blueprint that defines how network components are arranged and connected within a system. For documentation professionals, understanding network topology is crucial for creating accurate technical documentation, system diagrams, and user guides that explain complex network infrastructures.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Physical layout mapping of network components and connections</li><li>Logical data flow patterns between system elements</li><li>Hierarchical structure definition for network organization</li><li>Communication pathway documentation for troubleshooting</li><li>Scalability planning through topology visualization</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enables creation of accurate system architecture diagrams</li><li>Facilitates better understanding of information flow for user guides</li><li>Supports troubleshooting documentation with clear connection maps</li><li>Improves collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders</li><li>Provides foundation for API documentation and integration guides</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Network topology only applies to physical hardware connections</li><li>Topology diagrams are only useful for IT professionals</li><li>Simple networks don't require topology documentation</li><li>Topology remains static and doesn't need regular updates</li></ul>",
