    "quick_definition": "Pre-built templates are standardized document formats and structures that documentation teams can customize and reuse across projects. They ensure consistency, reduce creation time, and maintain brand standards while providing a foundation for various document types like user guides, API documentation, and process manuals.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Pre-built templates serve as the backbone of efficient documentation workflows, providing standardized frameworks that teams can adapt for specific needs while maintaining consistency across all documentation assets.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Standardized formatting with predefined styles, headers, and layouts</li><li>Placeholder content and sections that guide content creation</li><li>Built-in brand elements including logos, colors, and typography</li><li>Modular components that can be mixed and matched</li><li>Version control integration for template updates</li><li>Responsive design elements for multi-device compatibility</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces document creation time by 60-80%</li><li>Ensures brand consistency across all documentation</li><li>Minimizes formatting errors and style inconsistencies</li><li>Enables faster onboarding of new team members</li><li>Facilitates easier maintenance and updates</li><li>Improves user experience through familiar layouts</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Templates limit creativity - they actually provide structure for better content focus</li><li>One template fits all needs - effective template libraries include multiple specialized formats</li><li>Templates are only for large teams - small teams benefit equally from standardization</li><li>Pre-built means inflexible - modern templates are highly customizable</li></ul>",
