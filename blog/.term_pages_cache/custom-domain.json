    "quick_definition": "A custom domain is a personalized web address (like docs.yourcompany.com) that documentation teams use to host their content under their organization's brand, rather than using generic platform URLs (like platform.com/yourcompany/docs). This creates a professional, branded experience while maintaining control over the documentation's web presence and SEO value.",

        "title": "Enterprise API Documentation Branding",
        "problem": "A SaaS company's API documentation hosted on a generic platform URL (platform.com/company-docs) lacks credibility with enterprise customers and doesn't contribute to the company's domain authority.",
        "solution": "Implement a custom domain like api.company.com to host all API documentation, creating a professional branded experience that builds trust with enterprise developers.",
        "implementation": "1. Register or configure subdomain (api.company.com) 2. Update DNS CNAME records to point to documentation platform 3. Configure SSL certificate 4. Set up redirects from old URLs 5. Update all internal links and marketing materials",
        "outcome": "Increased developer trust, improved SEO rankings for API-related searches, and seamless brand experience leading to higher API adoption rates among enterprise customers."

        "title": "Multi-Product Documentation Consolidation",
        "problem": "A growing tech company has documentation scattered across different platforms with inconsistent URLs, making it difficult for users to find comprehensive product information and hurting overall brand cohesion.",
        "solution": "Establish a unified custom domain structure like help.company.com with organized subdirectories for each product, centralizing all documentation under one branded domain.",
        "implementation": "1. Plan URL structure (help.company.com/product-a, /product-b) 2. Set up custom domain with documentation platform 3. Migrate existing content to new structure 4. Implement proper redirects from old URLs 5. Create unified navigation and search",
        "outcome": "Improved user experience with centralized documentation, better SEO performance, reduced support tickets due to easier information discovery, and stronger brand consistency across all products."

        "title": "White-Label Documentation for Partners",
        "problem": "A B2B software provider needs to offer documentation to partners under their own branding, but the current generic platform URLs expose the underlying documentation system and break the white-label experience.",
        "solution": "Configure custom domains for each partner (docs.partner1.com, docs.partner2.com) that serve the same content with partner-specific branding and styling.",
        "implementation": "1. Set up custom domain capability with documentation platform 2. Create partner-specific DNS configurations 3. Implement dynamic branding based on domain 4. Configure SSL for each partner domain 5. Set up analytics tracking per partner",

        "title": "Internal Documentation Security and Access",
        "problem": "An enterprise needs to host internal documentation that requires secure access controls, but using external platform URLs raises security concerns and doesn't integrate well with existing corporate infrastructure.",
        "solution": "Deploy custom domain on internal subdomain (docs.internal.company.com) with integrated authentication and access controls that align with corporate security policies.",
        "implementation": "1. Configure internal subdomain with IT department 2. Set up custom domain with documentation platform 3. Integrate with corporate SSO/LDAP 4. Configure access controls and permissions 5. Implement audit logging and compliance features",
