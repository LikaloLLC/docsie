    "quick_definition": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that captures carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and power plants, then transports and stores them permanently underground to prevent atmospheric release. For documentation professionals, CCS represents a critical environmental technology requiring clear technical communication to diverse stakeholders including engineers, policymakers, and the public.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential climate technology that documentation professionals must understand to effectively communicate complex technical processes. CCS involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source, transporting them via pipeline or ship, and injecting them into underground geological formations for permanent storage.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Three-stage process: capture, transport, and storage of CO2 emissions</li><li>Multiple capture technologies including post-combustion, pre-combustion, and direct air capture</li><li>Underground storage in depleted oil/gas fields, saline aquifers, or unmineable coal seams</li><li>Monitoring and verification systems to ensure safe, permanent storage</li><li>Integration with existing industrial infrastructure and energy systems</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Develops expertise in emerging clean energy technologies</li><li>Creates opportunities for specialized technical writing in environmental sectors</li><li>Builds skills in translating complex engineering concepts for diverse audiences</li><li>Positions teams as subject matter experts in climate technology communication</li><li>Expands portfolio into high-growth sustainability documentation markets</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>CCS is not just for coal plants - it applies to cement, steel, and chemical industries</li><li>Storage is not temporary - CO2 is permanently sequestered underground</li><li>Technology is not experimental - commercial CCS projects operate worldwide</li><li>CCS complements rather than competes with renewable energy solutions</li></ul>",
