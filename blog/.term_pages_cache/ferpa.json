    "quick_definition": "FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records and grants parents/eligible students rights to access, review, and control disclosure of educational information. For documentation professionals, FERPA compliance requires implementing strict access controls, audit trails, and privacy safeguards when handling student data in educational technology systems and platforms.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a critical federal privacy law that documentation professionals in educational institutions must understand and implement. This 1974 legislation governs how educational organizations handle, store, and share student records, creating specific requirements for documentation systems and processes.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Grants parents rights to access their child's educational records until the student turns 18</li><li>Requires written consent before disclosing personally identifiable information from student records</li><li>Mandates that institutions maintain detailed logs of record access and disclosure</li><li>Establishes specific timeframes for responding to record requests (45 days maximum)</li><li>Defines directory information that can be shared without consent unless parents opt out</li><li>Applies to all educational institutions receiving federal funding</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides clear legal framework for student data handling procedures</li><li>Standardizes access control requirements across educational documentation systems</li><li>Creates accountability through mandatory audit trails and disclosure logs</li><li>Establishes consistent privacy standards for multi-institutional collaborations</li><li>Reduces legal liability through compliant documentation practices</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>FERPA doesn't apply to employment records of students working at the institution</li><li>Directory information can be disclosed without consent unless specifically restricted</li><li>FERPA rights transfer to students at age 18, not upon high school graduation</li><li>Legitimate educational interest allows broader internal access than many assume</li></ul>",
