    "quick_definition": "A Subject Matter Expert (SME) is an individual with deep, specialized knowledge and practical experience in a specific domain, process, or technology within an organization. For documentation teams, SMEs serve as the primary source of accurate, detailed information needed to create comprehensive and technically sound documentation. They bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and clear, accessible written content.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are the cornerstone of effective documentation projects, providing the specialized knowledge and insights that transform complex information into accessible, accurate documentation. They serve as the bridge between technical complexity and user understanding.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Deep domain expertise gained through hands-on experience and formal training</li><li>Ability to explain complex concepts in multiple ways to suit different audiences</li><li>Access to institutional knowledge and historical context</li><li>Understanding of both theoretical principles and practical applications</li><li>Awareness of common user pain points and frequently asked questions</li><li>Knowledge of industry standards, regulations, and best practices</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Ensures technical accuracy and completeness of documentation</li><li>Reduces research time and eliminates guesswork for writers</li><li>Provides real-world examples and use cases</li><li>Helps prioritize content based on user needs and business impact</li><li>Offers quality assurance through expert review and validation</li><li>Enables creation of advanced troubleshooting guides and edge case scenarios</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>SMEs are always the best writers - expertise doesn't guarantee communication skills</li><li>One SME can cover all aspects of a complex system</li><li>SMEs have unlimited time to support documentation projects</li><li>Technical knowledge alone qualifies someone as an effective SME for documentation</li></ul>",
