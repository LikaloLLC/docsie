    "quick_definition": "A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a structured document that defines what a product should accomplish, specifying its features, functionality, and user experience without detailing implementation methods. It serves as a central reference for documentation teams, developers, and stakeholders to align on product goals and user needs before development begins.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A Product Requirements Document (PRD) serves as the foundational blueprint that captures the vision, purpose, and specifications of a product before development begins. It articulates what the product should do, who it's for, and what problems it solves, providing a north star for all team members involved in the product lifecycle.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product Vision Statement:</strong> Concise articulation of the product's purpose and target audience</li>\n<li><strong>User Personas:</strong> Detailed profiles of intended users and their needs</li>\n<li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> Specific capabilities the product must deliver</li>\n<li><strong>Non-functional Requirements:</strong> Performance, security, and usability standards</li>\n<li><strong>User Stories:</strong> Narrative descriptions of how users will interact with features</li>\n<li><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong> Measurable conditions that define when requirements are met</li>\n<li><strong>Constraints and Dependencies:</strong> Limitations and external factors affecting development</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early Involvement:</strong> Enables documentation planning from the inception phase</li>\n<li><strong>Content Planning:</strong> Provides clear guidance on what features need documentation</li>\n<li><strong>Audience Alignment:</strong> Helps identify documentation needs for different user types</li>\n<li><strong>Terminology Foundation:</strong> Establishes consistent product terminology early</li>\n<li><strong>Scope Management:</strong> Clarifies what should be included in or excluded from documentation</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation Prioritization:</strong> Helps identify which features need more extensive documentation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not a Technical Specification:</strong> PRDs focus on what and why, not how implementation will occur</li>\n<li><strong>Not Set in Stone:</strong> PRDs evolve through feedback and changing requirements</li>\n<li><strong>Not Just for Product Managers:</strong> Documentation teams should actively contribute to and review PRDs</li>\n<li><strong>Not a Replacement for Documentation:</strong> PRDs complement but don't replace user guides or technical documentation</li>\n<li><strong>Not Just a Formality:</strong> PRDs serve as critical alignment tools, not bureaucratic checkboxes</li>\n</ul>",
