    "quick_definition": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an AI-powered translation approach that uses neural networks to translate complete sentences at once, considering context and meaning rather than translating word-by-word. This technology enables documentation teams to produce more accurate, contextually appropriate translations for global audiences. NMT significantly improves translation quality by understanding relationships between words and maintaining document coherence across languages.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) represents a revolutionary advancement in automated translation technology, utilizing deep learning neural networks to process and translate entire sentences simultaneously. Unlike traditional statistical machine translation methods that translate word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase, NMT considers the full context of sentences to produce more natural, accurate translations.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Context-aware translation that maintains meaning across entire sentences</li><li>Deep learning algorithms that continuously improve translation quality</li><li>Support for multiple language pairs with consistent accuracy</li><li>Ability to handle technical terminology and domain-specific language</li><li>Real-time translation capabilities for dynamic content</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Dramatically reduced translation time from weeks to hours</li><li>Consistent terminology usage across all translated documents</li><li>Lower translation costs compared to human-only translation</li><li>Scalable solution for large documentation libraries</li><li>Improved collaboration with global teams and stakeholders</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>NMT completely replaces human translators (it works best as a collaboration tool)</li><li>All NMT systems produce identical quality results (quality varies significantly)</li><li>Technical documentation doesn't benefit from NMT (specialized models excel at technical content)</li><li>NMT translations require no human review (post-editing remains essential for quality)</li></ul>",
