    "quick_definition": "Migration Support is specialized assistance that helps documentation teams transfer existing content, data, and systems from one platform to another while preserving formatting, structure, and functionality. It encompasses planning, execution, and validation processes to ensure seamless transitions with minimal disruption to documentation workflows and user access.",

        "problem": "Documentation team struggles with outdated wiki system that lacks modern features, has poor search functionality, and doesn't support collaborative editing or version control.",
        "solution": "Implement comprehensive migration support to transfer all wiki content to a modern documentation platform while preserving page hierarchy, internal links, and user permissions.",
        "implementation": "1. Conduct content audit to identify all pages, attachments, and user data. 2. Map wiki markup to new platform's formatting system. 3. Use automated migration tools to transfer content in batches. 4. Validate migrated content for formatting issues and broken links. 5. Set up redirects from old URLs to new locations. 6. Train team members on new platform features and workflows.",
        "outcome": "Team gains access to modern collaboration features, improved search capabilities, and better content organization while maintaining all historical documentation and user access patterns."

        "problem": "Documentation scattered across multiple platforms (Google Docs, Confluence, SharePoint, local files) creates confusion, duplication, and makes information difficult to find and maintain.",
        "solution": "Use migration support services to consolidate all documentation into a single, centralized platform with proper categorization and search functionality.",
        "implementation": "1. Inventory all documentation sources and assess content overlap. 2. Develop unified taxonomy and content structure. 3. Prioritize content based on usage and relevance. 4. Migrate high-priority content first using platform-specific extraction tools. 5. Merge duplicate content and update cross-references. 6. Implement governance policies to prevent future fragmentation.",
        "outcome": "Unified documentation experience with eliminated duplication, improved discoverability, and streamlined maintenance workflows for the documentation team."

        "title": "Format Standardization Migration",
        "problem": "Documentation exists in various formats (Word docs, PDFs, HTML files, Markdown) making it difficult to maintain consistency, update content, and provide unified user experience.",
        "solution": "Deploy migration support to convert all documentation to a standardized format while preserving content structure and implementing consistent styling and templates.",
        "implementation": "1. Define standard documentation format and style guidelines. 2. Create conversion templates and automated transformation rules. 3. Use format-specific migration tools to convert content systematically. 4. Review and adjust formatting inconsistencies manually. 5. Implement content templates for future documentation. 6. Establish workflow for maintaining format consistency.",
        "outcome": "Consistent documentation format across all content, easier maintenance and updates, improved user experience, and streamlined content creation processes."

        "implementation": "1. Export existing API documentation and code examples. 2. Convert documentation to OpenAPI specification format. 3. Set up new platform with interactive testing capabilities. 4. Migrate all endpoints, parameters, and response examples. 5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated documentation updates. 6. Test all interactive examples and update developer onboarding materials.",
        "outcome": "Enhanced developer experience with interactive API testing, automated documentation updates, improved accuracy through integration testing, and reduced maintenance overhead."
