    "quick_definition": "Custom HTML is manually written Hypertext Markup Language code that documentation professionals embed into web pages to create specialized functionality, interactive elements, or unique content layouts beyond standard templates. It allows teams to extend their documentation platforms with tailored solutions like custom widgets, interactive tutorials, or branded components.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Custom HTML empowers documentation teams to go beyond standard templates and create tailored user experiences by writing and embedding their own HTML code directly into documentation pages. This approach provides complete control over content presentation and functionality.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Direct HTML code insertion into documentation pages</li><li>Support for CSS styling and JavaScript functionality</li><li>Integration with external libraries and frameworks</li><li>Custom form creation and data collection</li><li>Interactive element development (tabs, accordions, modals)</li><li>Embedded multimedia and third-party widgets</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Complete creative control over page layout and design</li><li>Ability to create unique interactive learning experiences</li><li>Integration of specialized tools and calculators</li><li>Enhanced branding and visual consistency</li><li>Improved user engagement through custom interfaces</li><li>Cost-effective alternative to custom development</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Requires extensive programming knowledge (basic HTML is often sufficient)</li><li>Always breaks when platforms update (most platforms maintain HTML compatibility)</li><li>Negatively impacts SEO (properly structured HTML can improve SEO)</li><li>Creates security vulnerabilities (platforms typically sanitize custom HTML)</li></ul>",
