Three popular platforms in this space are **Document360, Gitbook, **and** Docsie**.\n\nAll three are comprehensive documentation solutions designed to simplify creating, managing, and publishing documentation.

Comparing the pricing structures of these platforms can help organisations make informed decisions based on their specific needs and budgets. Let's dive right into this!\n\n## Feature Comparison for Documentation Platforms:\n\n### Key features: \n\nYou can compare these documentation platforms based on key features for a feature analysis to help decide which platform could be used for what requirements.

Collaborative Editing:**\n\nAll three platforms, **Document360, Gitbook, and Docsie**, offer collaborative editing capabilities. This feature allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, promoting collaboration and facilitating real-time updates. \n\nWith collaborative editing, teams can collaborate seamlessly, making edits, adding comments, and discussing changes in real-time.
