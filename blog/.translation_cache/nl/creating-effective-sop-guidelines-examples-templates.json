Purpose-built software centralizes access and controls to these procedures. Driving continuous adherence requires multilayered strategies including training, accountability mechanisms, feedback channels, and cultural reinforcement. Although implementing SOP protocols requires initial effort, the long-term dividends are well worth the investment. With robust SOPs and software as a foundation, organizations can scale efficiently while maintaining consistency, developing employees, and delighting customers. SOPs demonstrate ROI by enhancing the way work is performed across the board.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n**Q1 - What is the purpose of creating an SOP?**\n\n**Ans**: SOPs help to break down a large project into small, digestible chunks of doable tasks. The primary aim of an SOP is to create a solid framework containing a set of instructions needed to complete a job. By maintaining SOPs, you can better ensure that your operations are carried on smoothly and effectively with zero distractions.\n\n \n\n**Q2 - Who should draft SOPs?**\n\n**Ans:** SOPs should always be drafted by subject matter experts or members directly involved in the project. It reduces the risk of providing misinformation and also rules out the possibility of focusing on the unimportant areas of the project. Whether it is a large organisation or an SME, drafting SOPs requires first-hand knowledge, expertise, credibility and experience in getting things done by following a predetermined set of instructions. \n\n\n**Q3 - Where should you store your SOPs?**\n\n**Ans**: There are various ways and locations where you can store your SOPs. But make sure that your choicest location fulfils two criteria - security and accessibility. \n\nChoose a secured location for your SOP since it might often contain sensitive information about your company which should be handled only by your trusted employees. With [Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/), you can control whom you are giving access to so that you can protect your documents with zero headaches. \n\nThose who are responsible for following the instructions and completing the task need complete access to your SOP document. They are responsible for adding or modifying any steps mentioned in the SOP as per the changes that might arise during project implementation. To make this possible, ensure that your SOP is stored in an accessible location so that team members can refer to it as and when required.",
