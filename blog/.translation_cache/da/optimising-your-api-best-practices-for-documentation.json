    "optimising-your-api-best-practices-for-d|markdown": "From cave scribbles to the recently launched Threads app, human communication has come a long way. In the same way, machines and apps communicate with each other all the time. In 2022, 63% of software developers used more APIs than in 2021. As per the [State of APIs Report from Rapid](https://www.devopsdigest.com/apis-are-the-future-of-software-development#:~:text=Developers%2C%20who%20are%20natural%20innovators,of%20APIs%20Report%20from%20Rapid.), the usage of API is rising consistently. Its variants are increasing and developers are rooting for enhanced tool efficiency and speed. But what is **API **writing? How does it help businesses to acquire more **customers**? Read along and find out everything about **API documentation tools. **\n\n## What is API Documentation?\n\n![What is API Documentation?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_poQhW1OMOPBQVkdLq/image9.png)\n\nAPI documentation refers to the process of creating a technical document using reliable and efficient **API documentation tools**. It is an instruction manual that shares detailed information on the API and provides specific guidelines on effective API integration, maintenance and usage. \n\nFrom **code examples** to tutorials, screenshots to video contentâ€”this documentation provides complete guidelines that help developers and users understand the different aspects of the API and work with the same. \n\nAfter you complete your documentation draft through tools like [Docsie](https://app.docsie.io/login/#/), it is shared amongst all the stakeholders. Good API documentation contains a description of API features, API endpoints, specific examples of how to use the API, etc. \n\nThe hallmark of a good API document is that both your beginners and advanced **customers **can use it. So, if you wish to write good, detailed and descriptive documents, discard technical language and jargon. Break down complex concepts and explain technical ideas in simple and plain language.  \n\n## Types and Structure\n\nBy using an interactive **API documentation tool** like [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/demo/), you can write explanatory documents that are easy to understand and implement. \n\n![API documentation tool](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_mfhOkMpNzkEprY1MQ/image7.png)\n\nBroadly classified, there are **three types of APIs**:\n\n### 1. For team members\n\nSometimes, companies have an internal API and only particular team members have access and can use it. This kind of API generally streamlines the process of data transfer between systems as well as teams. In this case, the company's internal developers remain in charge of the document. \n\n### 2. For counterparts\n\nCompanies that provide the API, share this outside the organisation where they give access to a second party. In such cases, there exists a business relationship between the two companies. The security measures in these kinds of APIs are relatively stringent. Only authorised clients can gain access to view, maintain and suggest changes. \n\n### 3. For end users\n\nThese are open APIs, so any developer is free to use them. There are no authorisation measures or strict authentication involved herein. Most of the time, these APIs are available for free since the providers want more and more adoption. But sometimes, these come with a subscription fee. This cost, however, depends on how many API calls are made. \n\n## What are API Documentation Tools?\n\nDo you wish your API document was simple, easy to read and filled with more interactive elements? Drop all your worries and choose a documentation tool like [Docsie](https://site.docsie.io/) that can make your document more consistent and more presentable. \n\nThese tools help API providers and offer them the experience of working with an **interactive API documentation** interface. The most notable features of such tools include automatic document generation from API specifications, automatic documentation updating, different documentation versions, personalisation options, etc. \n\nIf you are using top-rated API documentation tools such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/), you can not only write, organise and maintain your documents; but you can also beautify them using the platform's trendy design features. \n\nOn one hand, these tools help writers to keep their documentation organised and on the other hand, these make it easier for developers, product managers and team members to understand **APIs** and use them effectively.\n\n## Benefits of API Documentation Tools\n\nTools like [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) contribute to enhancing developer productivity. By going through a well-drafted API document, developers can easily understand the functionality and purpose of each endpoint. This decreases the probability of errors and also saves a lot of time and effort. \n\nThrough proper documentation, companies creating APIs transfer **data** and precious information about their product to the partner companies. Technical writers can use such documents as their reliable source to create guides and tutorials for the end **customers**. Thus, these documents ensure collaboration and offer a seamless experience for everyone working with the particular API. \n\nAPI documents not only explain product features but also share guidelines along with proper code examples. The tools help writers take up each API feature, explain complex ideas and talk in detail about the API's various use cases. This helps developers understand the abilities and limitations of the API and build applications accordingly. \n\n## How to Choose API Documentation Tools?\n\n![How to Choose API Documentation Tools?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_Rf37TTrGuHN9CI72t/image6.png)\n\nThe tech market is full of several documentation tools. We understand how overwhelming it might be! To ease things out, here are the five factors that we recommend you should check while choosing your preferred tool:\n\n### 1. Hassle-free integration \n\nLook for the tool that shares good compatibility with the other tools you often use. For example, your chosen tool should offer seamless integration with integration systems, version control, etc. \n\n### 2. Simple and customisable  \n\nGo for tools that provide a unique user experience. The selected tool should help you prepare easily customisable excellent documents in the minimum time. \n\n### 3. Security\n\nThe aim of your tool is to make your document user-friendly. So, select an app like Docsie that has enhanced security so that your **customers **remain safe from undesirable and malicious attacks. \n\n### 4. Support\n\nConsider tools having a developer community and go for the ones which offer troubleshooting resources and other product-related assistance. The customer service of your chosen provider should be supportive and responsive.  \n\n### 5. Cost\n\nKeep your budget in mind and consider tools that are value for money. Check their **scalability**, features and benefits and consider their limitations to find out if the particular product is worth your expenditure. \n\n## Who writes API documentation?\n\nSometimes, developers who create the APIs take up the task of documentation. However, such documents can become too technical. Therefore, companies hire professional technical writers to work on the documentation. \n\nTechnical writers can understand complex language. And they can also write engaging content while conveying relevant information. API writers must understand the source code and derive sufficient information for **interactive API documentation.**\n\nAn API writer typically has the perfect blend of language and programming skills. Good knowledge of programming languages, understanding of formatting standards, excellent communication skills, and knowledge of editorial tools - these are some of the chief qualifications an API writer should have. \n\nThe ideal candidate is someone who knows about programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, etc., and also has some experience and expertise in the domain of technical writing. Individuals with in-depth knowledge of Software Development Kit (SDK) can also do this kind of writing. \n\n## What are the best practices for API documentation?\n\n|What|Why|\n|-|-|\n|||\n|Understand your customers|Find out your potential audience before you start writing about your API. Normally, there will be two kinds of audience groups - product managers and technical leaders who assess the API and developers who actively interact and use your API. |\n|Keep it simple|People with varying levels of expertise and experience will read your document. So, keep your language plain, simple and easy to understand. Stay away from jargon and highly technical language that can put off some of your readers. |\n|Introduce quick guides|Choose API documentation tools that can help you provide quickstart guides for easy onboarding of your new developers. Make sure that these guides contain code samples and instructions regarding API usage. Your primary goal should be to make your API as accessible as possible. |\n|Cover all aspects of API|Make your API documentation comprehensive. It should have references, guides and loads of examples so that readers can refer to it as an instruction manual. Cover all aspects of your API, answering the common questions of your audience. |\n|Add reference documentation|Include a comprehensive list mentioning the methods and objects that your API exposes. Add a description and explain how to use each one of them. This will help developers understand the usability of your API. |\n|Maintain your document|Update your document regularly. Remove wrong information and inaccuracies and maintain a document that answers the frequently asked questions of the developers. Ensure that your document reflects the newest addition to your API and has complete information on how it can be of help. |\n## Your Perfect API Companion- Docsie\n\nThe one-stop shop for all your documentation needs, Docsie provides an effective and reliable tool that you can use to create, maintain and edit your API documents. \n\n![Your Perfect API Companion- Docsie 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_qGXGtgxj0vejosSJB/image5.png)\n\nFrom **ready-to-use** templates to auto-generation documentation and multiple versionsâ€”this tool comes with a wide range of features so that you can experience a seamless API document creation journey. \n\n![Ready-to-use templates ](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_TrnppJvOBJgTTHVN0/image3.png)\n\n## What makes Docsie different from other tools?\n\n![What makes Docsie different from other tools?\n](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_am5Sn98pQV49CS6O2/image8.png)\n\nIt serves as a centralised documentation resource for your team members and end users.
