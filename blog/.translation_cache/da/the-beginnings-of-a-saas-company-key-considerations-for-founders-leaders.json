Then came the age of millennials, who witnessed a tech evolution with countless new apps transforming life. Today, there's software for nearly every need from companionship through chatbots, to endless online entertainment (more entertainment than you can even handle) It's all powered by innovative software, simplifying and enriching our lives. The key to all this? Software special computer programs that make our lives easier and more fun.\n\nThese super-useful programs are called \"**Software as a Service**\" (SaaS). They're like apps you access online. SaaS has become super popular, kind of like a \"milking cow\" for businesses, because it brings in steady money.\n\n*Numbers do not lie; just look at these stats*:\n\n[The global SaaS market is currently worth about ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-saas-factor-six-ways-to-drive-growth-by-building-new-saas-businesses)[$3 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-saas-factor-six-ways-to-drive-growth-by-building-new-saas-businesses)[, and estimates indicate it could surge to ](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-saas-factor-six-ways-to-drive-growth-by-building-new-saas-businesses)[$10 trillion by 2030](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-saas-factor-six-ways-to-drive-growth-by-building-new-saas-businesses)\n\n[The SaaS industry has an ](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/)[annual growth rate of 18%](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/).\n\n[SaaS growth can generate between](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/)[$5 million to $100 million in annual recurring revenue](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/).\n\n[By the end of 2023,](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/)[99% of companies will be using one or more SaaS solutions](https://www.zippia.com/advice/saas-industry-statistics/).\n\nThinking of starting your own business? A SaaS product is a promising opportunity but it has a unique set of challenges.! This guide will help you get started, first by finding a problem your program can solve, to building a team and launching your first minimum viable product. Let's turn your awesome idea into a profitable program!\n\n## What Is a SaaS Company?\n\nImagine you're creating a business that provides **software services over the internet**. Instead of selling physical products, you offer digital tools or applications that people can use online. SaaS companies are like virtual toolboxes where customers can access software without installing anything on their computers.\n\n## Why Are SaaS Companies Popular?\n\n**1. Scalability**: The rapid growth of SaaS businesses is largely due to the scalability offered by cloud platforms. Unlike traditional businesses bound by the physical limits of stores or factories, SaaS companies leverage cloud computing's flexible resources. This allows them to efficiently scale their infrastructure up or down to match client demands, ensuring they always have just the right capacity without the overhead of unused space or idle equipment.\n\n**2. Recurring Revenue**: Customers pay regularly (monthly or yearly), which helps sustain the business.\n\n**3. Global Reach**: You can serve people all around the world, not just in your local area.\n\nHowever, the road to establishing a successful SaaS company is paved with difficult decisions and trial-and-error, especially in the early stages.\n\n## Understanding the Market and Defining Your Niche\n\nBefore diving into the technicalities of building your product, you must clearly understand the market plan to enter.\n\nLet's take an example: Imagine if you're baking cookies, you wouldn't just throw ingredients together without knowing who you're baking for! Same logic goes around while building a product.\n\n**Here's how you can learn more about your \"cookie eaters\":**\n\n**Who are you trying to help?** Are you making cookies for kids who love chocolate chips or for adults who prefer healthier options? In the product world, this is your target audience.\n\n**What problems do they have?** Maybe the kids always want more chocolate chips, or the adults struggle to find healthy cookies that taste good. These are their pain points.\n\n**How can your product be the perfect cookie?**  Can you make cookies packed with chocolate chips that are still good for them or offer healthy, delicious options for adults? This is where your product comes in as a unique solution.\n\nBy figuring this out early on, you can build a product that people actually want and market it to the right audience. Conduct thorough market research to identify your target audience, understand their pain points, and determine how your product can provide a unique solution. *Afterall, if you don't mix the ingredients in the right amounts, the cookies won't taste good!* Define your niche early on to tailor your product development and marketing efforts more effectively. \n\n## Developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n\nA crucial step in the early stages of a SaaS company is the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). MVP allows you to test your product's core functionality with real users and gather feedback without investing heavily in full-scale development.\n\n**Think of an MVP like a prototype.** It's a basic version of your product with just the core features that solve the main problem for your target audience. Imagine it's the first draft of a book - it has the main story but not all the bells and whistles yet. The goal is to get your product in front of real people as soon as possible to see how they use it and what feedback they have. This helps you avoid spending a lot of time and money building features that nobody wants.\n\nBy incorporating user feedback, you can iterate and improve your product quickly. This way, you're constantly building something that people actually need and enjoy using.\n\n## Outsourcing Software Development\n\nFor many SaaS leaders, outsourcing software development is a strategic move to accelerate the MVP process. Outsourcing means contracting a company in another location to develop your software. This lets you tap into a global pool of talented developers.\n\nPartnering with a [nearshore software development company](https://azumo.com/nearshore-software-development)[](https://azumo.com/nearshore-software-development) can provide access to skilled developers who can bring your vision to life efficiently and cost-effectively. Outsourcing also allows you to focus on other critical aspects of your business, such as customer acquisition and building investor relationships.\n\nWhen considering outsourcing, it's important to choose a partner that aligns with your company's values and goals. For instance, a provider that offers [Python development services outsourcing](https://azumo.com/technologies/python-development) can be particularly beneficial for SaaS companies due to Python's versatility and the speed at which applications can be developed.\n\n## Building a Strong Foundation with Docsie\n\n*Imagine it: you're building a new SaaS product, but every time you tweak a feature, there's a mountain of instructions to rewrite. Ugh! Documentation can feel like a never-ending chore, slowing down writers and confusing users.*\n\nLaying a strong foundation is crucial for any SaaS company, and that includes having a system for clear and accessible documentation. Think of it as the instruction manual for your product - it guides users, reduces support tickets, and ultimately, keeps them happy.\n\nThat's why having the right tools in place is vital for success. Docsie is a platform that can streamline your documentation process, making it easier to manage and update your product's documentation as it evolves. (perhaps call out some of the main Docsie features - e.g. AI Docs, Help Centers, In-App Help, Project Management, SSO and Enterprise features etc)\n\nDocsie makes the documentation writing process a piece of cake!! It's like cleaning up a messy room full of papers - or in this case, full of scattered emails and files - and turning it into a neat filing cabinet. No more getting lost in a maze of outdated information!\n\nDocsie keeps everything organized, current, and accessible for both you and your users. Updating instructions becomes a breeze, and working with your team is smooth sailing. Imagine never having to worry about messy instructions again - that's the Docsie advantage!\n\nBy using Docsie, you can focus on building a great product instead of wrestling with confusing instructions.
