Here are a few:\n\n**1. Enhanced Productivity:**\n\nAn investigation by[ ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy)[McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy) demonstrated that knowledge workers spend approximately 1.8 weeks per year hunting and recovering information. Unsearchable PDFs would incur time wastage as instead of scrolling through page after page, you'd have to scroll through the whole PDF. A searchable PDF gives you the ability to search for information you want simply by entering a keyword you are looking for.\n\n**2. Improved Information Accessibility:**\n\nA survey reported that[ ](https://investor.manpowergroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/talent-shortages-record-high-45-employers-around-world-report)[45 percent](https://investor.manpowergroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/talent-shortages-record-high-45-employers-around-world-report) of employees claimed they have difficulty finding the information they need to perform their job well. Enabling the search function of the documents guarantees that this information can be used by everyone who needs it.\n\n**3. Boosted Collaboration:**\n\nSearchable PDFs can greatly enhance collaboration among the team members by providing the ability to find relevant information very quickly within the document. This has a particular effect when it comes to projects that require collaboration.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Searchable PDFs:\n\n|Feature|Pros|Cons|\n|-|-|-|\n|Searchability|Faster information retrieval, improved accessibility, enhanced collaboration|May require additional processing time (depending on the method)|\n|Text-based content|Easier to search and edit|Requires OCR for scanned documents|\n|File size|Can be smaller than image-based PDFs|File size may increase with embedded searchability features|\n|Security|Password protection and encryption can be applied to searchable PDFs|These searchable PDFs require additional security measures to protect sensitive information|\n|Archiving|Searchable PDFs can be easily archived and retrieved|Long-term archiving of certain searchable PDF formats may require specific software|\n \n\n## 5 Methods to Make PDFs Searchable\n\nThe PDFs can be made searchable in several ways, which have benefits and shortcomings. Here's a breakdown of the most common approaches:\n\n### 1. Utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\nThis technique is perfectly suitable for PDFs with text in image format. OCR technology is a process of converting scanned text to a searchable format. Many online tools and software programs offer OCR capabilities, including many online tools and software programs offer OCR capabilities, including:\n\n1. [Adobe Acrobat Pro DC](https://www.adobe.com/es_eu/acrobat/acrobat-pro.html) (Paid program)\n\n2. [Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/) (Free online tool with a limited amount of options)\n\n3. [ ](https://xodo.com/)[Xodo](https://xodo.com/) ( a free mobile app with OCR functionality).\n\n \n\n### 2.Checking for Existing Searchability:\nThe text of not all PDFs is the same. Some PDF files are already designed as searchable documents because they were created with a text layer embedded in the document. If you try to highlight the text in the PDF with your mouse, that is usually a strong indication that the document is locked. If the text is highlighted, it may be already done by the search engine.\n\n### 3.Utilizing Online Conversion Tools\n\nMany online conversion tools are available that can help you convert your PDF document into a searchable format, including a Word document. The tool usually uses the OCR technology to extract the text from the PDF document. Here are a couple of popular options to make searchable PDFs:\n\n1. [PDF2Go](https://www.pdf2go.com/)\n\n2. [ ](https://www.ilovepdf.com/)[Ilovepdf](https://www.ilovepdf.com/)\n\n \n\n### 4.Leveraging Paid Software\n\nFor advanced users looking for more powerful features, commercial software like Adobe Acrobat Pro DC has a complete set of tools for creating and managing searchable PDFs. These programs usually include high-quality OCR as well as editing options.\n\n### 5.Docsie's Effortless Searchable PDF Solution (Most Efficient)\n\n\n\nDocsie, a popular document management service, makes it possible to create and store searchable PDFs.

In contrast to \"**Report_Oct2023.pdf**\", choose \"**Marketing_Campaign_Performance_Report_October_2023.pdf**\" instead. Such a name is not only more informative but also more searchable in our Docsie system.\n\n* **Employ proper formatting**: The use of headings, subheadings, and bullet points can improve the readability and searchability of your PDFs. Search engines commonly rank well-structured documents higher in search results, thus making them easy to find.\n\n* **Consider using bookmarks:** Bookmarking is useful for moving around a lengthy document, especially those with more than one division. They provide the means to directly go to the desired part of the document, which will save users a lot of time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUtilizing these techniques will serve to take your PDFs from being just static documents to becoming dynamic information sources.
