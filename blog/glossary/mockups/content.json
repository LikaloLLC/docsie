    "quick_definition": "Mockups are static visual representations of a product's interface that demonstrate the final design appearance, including colors, typography, and imagery. They serve as high-fidelity prototypes that help documentation teams visualize and communicate design concepts before development begins.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Mockups are essential design artifacts that bridge the gap between conceptual wireframes and functional prototypes in documentation projects. They provide a realistic preview of how the final product will appear to users, incorporating actual visual elements like brand colors, fonts, images, and content layout.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>High-fidelity visual representation with realistic colors, typography, and imagery</li><li>Static nature that focuses on appearance rather than functionality</li><li>Detailed layout specifications including spacing, alignment, and proportions</li><li>Brand-consistent design elements and style guidelines</li><li>Multiple screen sizes and device variations</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enables clear communication of design intent to stakeholders and developers</li><li>Reduces misunderstandings and revision cycles during development</li><li>Facilitates early feedback collection before costly development begins</li><li>Serves as visual reference for creating accurate documentation screenshots</li><li>Helps maintain design consistency across documentation platforms</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Mockups are not interactive prototypes - they show appearance, not functionality</li><li>They're not final designs - mockups can still undergo changes based on feedback</li><li>Mockups don't replace user testing - they're tools for visual communication</li><li>They're not just pretty pictures - mockups include detailed design specifications</li></ul>",

        "implementation": "1. Collaborate with product designers to obtain feature wireframes 2. Create high-fidelity mockups showing the feature in various states 3. Design step-by-step visual flows for user actions 4. Generate mockup-based screenshots for documentation 5. Update with actual screenshots once feature is developed",

        "implementation": "1. Identify target languages and their specific requirements (RTL, text expansion ratios) 2. Create base mockups with flexible layouts and spacing 3. Develop language-specific variations showing text expansion scenarios 4. Design mockups for different cultural color and imagery preferences 5. Test layouts with native speakers and cultural consultants",
