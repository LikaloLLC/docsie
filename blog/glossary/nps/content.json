    "quick_definition": "Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a customer loyalty metric that measures how likely users are to recommend your documentation to others on a scale of 0-10. Documentation teams use NPS to gauge user satisfaction, identify content gaps, and prioritize improvements based on direct user feedback.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely-adopted metric that helps documentation teams understand user satisfaction and loyalty by asking one simple question: \"How likely are you to recommend this documentation to a colleague?\" Users respond on a scale of 0-10, with scores categorized into Detractors (0-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10).</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Simple single-question survey format that reduces user friction</li><li>Standardized 0-10 scale for consistent measurement across teams</li><li>Automatic categorization of responses into three user segments</li><li>Benchmarkable score calculation (% Promoters - % Detractors)</li><li>Optional follow-up questions for qualitative insights</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Quantifies user satisfaction with specific documentation sections</li><li>Identifies high-performing content that can be replicated</li><li>Reveals pain points requiring immediate attention</li><li>Provides data-driven justification for documentation investments</li><li>Tracks improvement trends over time</li><li>Enables comparison between different documentation formats or topics</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>NPS alone provides complete user satisfaction insights (needs qualitative data)</li><li>All documentation should achieve the same NPS targets</li><li>Higher scores always indicate better documentation quality</li><li>NPS surveys should be deployed on every page or interaction</li></ul>",

        "solution": "Deploy NPS surveys at key completion points in API documentation workflows to identify friction points",
        "implementation": "1. Add NPS widgets after code examples, authentication guides, and endpoint references\n2. Segment responses by developer experience level and use case\n3. Follow up with detractors to understand specific pain points\n4. Track NPS trends as documentation improvements are implemented",

        "implementation": "1. Add NPS surveys to high-traffic help articles\n2. Compare NPS scores with traditional metrics like bounce rate\n3. Identify articles with high traffic but low NPS for revision\n4. Use promoter feedback to understand what makes content exceptional",

A/B test different documentation approaches and measure NPS impact\n4. Build feedback loops from low-scoring sections back to content creators",
