    "quick_definition": "Video interviews are remote interview sessions conducted through video conferencing technology that enable documentation professionals to gather information from subject matter experts, stakeholders, and users in real-time. These virtual meetings combine visual and audio communication to facilitate effective knowledge transfer and documentation research.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Video interviews have become an essential tool for documentation professionals, enabling them to conduct remote research sessions and gather critical information from subject matter experts, stakeholders, and end-users regardless of geographical constraints.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Real-time visual and audio communication through video conferencing platforms</li><li>Screen sharing capabilities for demonstrating processes and workflows</li><li>Recording functionality for later review and transcription</li><li>Multi-participant support for group interviews and collaborative sessions</li><li>Chat features for sharing links, documents, and follow-up questions</li><li>Integration with calendar systems and scheduling tools</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Access to remote experts and stakeholders without travel costs</li><li>Ability to capture non-verbal cues and visual demonstrations</li><li>Flexible scheduling across different time zones</li><li>Recorded sessions serve as permanent reference materials</li><li>Reduced time-to-documentation through immediate clarification</li><li>Enhanced collaboration between distributed team members</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Video interviews are less effective than in-person meetings for gathering detailed information</li><li>Technical difficulties make video interviews unreliable for professional documentation work</li><li>Video interviews cannot capture complex visual processes or demonstrations</li><li>Remote interviews result in less engagement from participants</li></ul>",
