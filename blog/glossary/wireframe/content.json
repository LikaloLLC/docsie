    "quick_definition": "A wireframe is a low-fidelity visual blueprint that outlines the basic structure, layout, and content hierarchy of a document or interface without detailed design elements. It serves as a foundational planning tool that helps documentation teams organize information architecture and user flow before creating the final content.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A wireframe is a skeletal framework that represents the basic structure and layout of a document, webpage, or user interface. In documentation, wireframes serve as essential planning tools that help teams visualize content organization, navigation flow, and information hierarchy before investing time in detailed writing and design.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Simple boxes and placeholders representing content areas</li><li>Clear indication of navigation elements and menu structures</li><li>Content hierarchy through size and positioning</li><li>Basic interaction flows and user pathways</li><li>Minimal visual design to focus on structure</li><li>Annotations explaining functionality and content types</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces revision cycles by establishing structure early</li><li>Facilitates stakeholder alignment before content creation</li><li>Identifies potential usability issues in advance</li><li>Streamlines collaboration between writers, designers, and developers</li><li>Provides clear roadmap for content development</li><li>Helps estimate project scope and resource requirements</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Wireframes are only for web designers, not documentation teams</li><li>They need to include detailed visual design elements</li><li>Creating wireframes slows down the documentation process</li><li>They're unnecessary for simple documentation projects</li><li>Wireframes must be created using specialized software</li></ul>",

        "implementation": "1. Map out common elements needed for each endpoint\n2. Create template wireframes showing header, navigation, content sections\n3. Define consistent placement for code samples and try-it functionality\n4. Plan progressive disclosure for advanced options\n5. Design clear pathways between related endpoints",

        "implementation": "1. Audit existing content and identify main categories\n2. Create site-wide wireframes showing navigation structure\n3. Design article template wireframes with consistent elements\n4. Plan search functionality and filtering options\n5. Map user journeys from entry points to solutions",

        "implementation": "1. Identify primary user tasks and goals\n2. Create wireframes prioritizing most common use cases\n3. Design clear visual hierarchy with headings and white space\n4. Plan placement of images, diagrams, and callout boxes\n5. Structure content for both linear reading and quick reference",

Plan placement of help resources and exit points\n4. Design clear calls-to-action and navigation between steps\n5. Include feedback mechanisms and alternative pathways",
