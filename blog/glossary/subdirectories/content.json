    "quick_definition": "Subdirectories are folder structures within a website's URL path that organize content hierarchically, such as /docs/api/authentication/. They create logical content organization that improves both user navigation and search engine optimization by establishing clear information architecture.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Subdirectories represent the hierarchical folder structure visible in website URLs, creating organized pathways that guide users through content logically. For documentation teams, subdirectories serve as the backbone of information architecture, determining how users discover and navigate through technical content.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Hierarchical URL structure that reflects content organization</li><li>SEO benefits through keyword-rich paths and content categorization</li><li>Logical grouping of related documentation topics</li><li>Breadcrumb navigation support for improved user experience</li><li>Scalable structure that accommodates growing content libraries</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Improved content discoverability through organized navigation paths</li><li>Enhanced SEO performance with structured, keyword-optimized URLs</li><li>Easier content maintenance and updates within defined categories</li><li>Better analytics tracking for specific documentation sections</li><li>Consistent user experience across different content types</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Deeper subdirectory levels always hurt SEO performance</li><li>Subdirectories are only important for large documentation sites</li><li>URL structure doesn't impact user engagement metrics</li><li>Subdirectories can't be changed without breaking existing links</li></ul>",
