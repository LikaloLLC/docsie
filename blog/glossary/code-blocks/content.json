  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Code blocks are formatted sections in documentation that display programming code with syntax highlighting, proper indentation, and copy-paste functionality. They enhance readability by distinguishing code from regular text and often include features like line numbers, language detection, and one-click copying for improved developer experience.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Code blocks are essential formatting elements in technical documentation that present programming code in a visually distinct, readable format. They serve as the bridge between written instructions and practical implementation, making complex code examples accessible to developers and technical users.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Syntax highlighting that color-codes different programming language elements</li><li>Monospace font rendering for consistent character spacing</li><li>Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy code reuse</li><li>Line numbering for precise reference and debugging</li><li>Language detection and labeling for context</li><li>Preserved formatting including indentation and whitespace</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Improved code readability reduces user confusion and support tickets</li><li>Enhanced user experience through interactive copy-paste features</li><li>Professional appearance that builds trust in documentation quality</li><li>Reduced formatting errors when displaying complex code examples</li><li>Better accessibility through proper semantic markup</li><li>Streamlined maintenance with automated syntax validation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Code blocks are only for programming languages - they also work for configuration files, command lines, and structured data</li><li>Syntax highlighting is purely aesthetic - it actually improves comprehension and reduces errors</li><li>All code blocks are the same - different platforms offer varying levels of interactivity and features</li></ul>",

        "implementation": "1. Create separate code blocks for request examples, response formats, and error codes 2. Use language-specific highlighting (json, bash, javascript) 3. Add copy buttons to each block 4. Include inline comments explaining key parameters 5. Provide multiple language examples (cURL, Python, JavaScript)",

        "implementation": "1. Use code blocks for error messages with 'text' or 'log' highlighting 2. Format diagnostic commands with 'bash' or relevant language 3. Show expected vs. actual outputs in separate blocks 4. Use consistent styling for different types of technical content 5. Add search-friendly formatting for common error patterns",
