    "quick_definition": "Callout blocks are visually distinct sections in documentation that highlight critical information such as warnings, tips, notes, or important context. They use special formatting like colored backgrounds, icons, or borders to immediately draw readers' attention to key content that shouldn't be overlooked.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Callout blocks are essential visual elements in modern documentation that break up text flow and emphasize crucial information. They serve as visual anchors that guide readers through complex content while ensuring important details don't get buried in lengthy paragraphs.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Visual distinction through colors, borders, or background shading</li><li>Standardized icons or symbols for different content types (warning, tip, note)</li><li>Consistent typography and spacing that maintains document hierarchy</li><li>Semantic meaning that helps users quickly identify content purpose</li><li>Responsive design that works across different devices and screen sizes</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces support tickets by highlighting common pitfalls and solutions</li><li>Improves user comprehension and task completion rates</li><li>Creates consistent information architecture across documentation</li><li>Enables quick scanning and information retrieval for time-pressed users</li><li>Supports accessibility standards through proper semantic markup</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>More callout blocks always improve documentation quality</li><li>All important information should be placed in callouts</li><li>Visual design is more important than semantic meaning</li><li>Callouts can replace clear writing and logical content structure</li></ul>",
