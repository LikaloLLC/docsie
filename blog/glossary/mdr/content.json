    "quick_definition": "MDR (Medical Device Regulation) is a comprehensive European Union regulation that establishes stringent safety and performance requirements for medical devices sold in the EU market. It requires extensive documentation, risk management, and clinical evaluation processes that documentation professionals must carefully manage to ensure regulatory compliance.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks governing medical devices in the European Union. For documentation professionals, MDR compliance requires meticulous attention to technical documentation, risk management files, and clinical evaluation reports that must meet strict regulatory standards.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Comprehensive technical documentation requirements including design dossiers and clinical evaluation reports</li><li>Mandatory post-market surveillance documentation and adverse event reporting systems</li><li>Unique Device Identification (UDI) system requiring detailed product documentation</li><li>Enhanced clinical evidence requirements with extensive documentation trails</li><li>Stricter notified body oversight requiring robust document management processes</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Standardized documentation frameworks that improve consistency across medical device portfolios</li><li>Clear regulatory guidelines that reduce ambiguity in technical writing requirements</li><li>Enhanced traceability systems that streamline document version control and audit trails</li><li>Improved collaboration between technical writers, regulatory affairs, and quality assurance teams</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>MDR only affects manufacturers - actually impacts all stakeholders including documentation service providers</li><li>Existing documentation can be easily adapted - often requires complete restructuring of document hierarchies</li><li>Translation is sufficient for compliance - requires localization considering cultural and regulatory nuances</li><li>One-time compliance effort - requires ongoing documentation maintenance and updates</li></ul>",
