        "title": "Customizing Documentation Templates",
        "problem": "Different documentation types require unique layouts, but creating custom templates from scratch is technically challenging for content teams.",
        "solution": "Provide drag and drop template customization allowing teams to modify existing templates by repositioning elements like headers, sidebars, and content blocks.",
        "implementation": "1. Create template editor with draggable layout components 2. Implement responsive design preview 3. Allow saving custom templates for team reuse 4. Include role-based permissions for template modifications 5. Provide rollback to default template options",
        "outcome": "Template customization accessibility increased by 300%, reduced dependency on developers for layout changes, improved brand consistency across documentation."

        "title": "Managing Multi-language Content",
        "problem": "Coordinating content updates across multiple language versions requires careful synchronization and often leads to inconsistent structure between translations.",
        "solution": "Enable drag and drop synchronization where structural changes made to the master language version can be applied to all translations while preserving translated text.",
        "implementation": "1. Create master-translation linking system 2. Implement drag operations that update structure across all language versions 3. Preserve translated content during reorganization 4. Provide conflict resolution for structural differences 5. Include translation status indicators during drag operations",
        "outcome": "Multi-language maintenance efficiency improved by 60%, reduced structural inconsistencies between language versions, faster time-to-market for localized documentation."
