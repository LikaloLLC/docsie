    "quick_definition": "Legacy systems are older computing systems, technologies, or applications that remain in active use despite being outdated or difficult to integrate with modern tools. These systems often contain critical business data and processes but present challenges for documentation teams due to compatibility issues, limited support, and outdated interfaces.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Legacy systems represent the backbone of many organizations' operations, consisting of older computing infrastructure, software applications, and technologies that continue to serve essential business functions despite their age. For documentation professionals, these systems present unique challenges and opportunities in maintaining comprehensive organizational knowledge.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Built on outdated programming languages or frameworks</li><li>Limited or no vendor support available</li><li>Difficult integration with modern APIs and tools</li><li>Contains critical historical data and business processes</li><li>Often lacks comprehensive documentation</li><li>May use proprietary formats or protocols</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides deep institutional knowledge and historical context</li><li>Offers opportunities to create valuable documentation for underdocumented systems</li><li>Enables knowledge preservation during system transitions</li><li>Supports compliance and audit requirements</li><li>Facilitates training for new team members on existing processes</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Legacy systems should always be immediately replaced</li><li>Documentation for legacy systems isn't worth the investment</li><li>Legacy systems are inherently insecure or unreliable</li><li>Modern tools cannot effectively document legacy system processes</li><li>Legacy system knowledge is only valuable to technical teams</li></ul>",
