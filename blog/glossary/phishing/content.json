    "quick_definition": "Phishing is a cybersecurity attack where malicious actors send fraudulent emails or messages disguised as legitimate communications to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access. For documentation teams, this poses significant risks to proprietary content, user data, and platform security. Understanding phishing threats is essential for maintaining secure documentation workflows and protecting sensitive organizational knowledge.",
