    "quick_definition": "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol that encrypts data transmitted between web servers and browsers, protecting sensitive information from interception. While technically superseded by TLS (Transport Layer Security), SSL remains the commonly used term for secure web connections indicated by HTTPS URLs and padlock icons in browsers.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a cryptographic protocol that establishes secure, encrypted connections between web servers and client browsers. Although TLS has technically replaced SSL, the term SSL is still widely used to describe secure web communications that protect data from eavesdropping and tampering during transmission.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Data encryption using asymmetric and symmetric cryptography</li><li>Server authentication through digital certificates</li><li>Data integrity verification to prevent tampering</li><li>Browser compatibility with visual security indicators</li><li>Multiple cipher suites for different security levels</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Protects user login credentials and personal information</li><li>Builds trust with documentation users through visible security indicators</li><li>Prevents content tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks</li><li>Improves SEO rankings as search engines favor HTTPS sites</li><li>Ensures compliance with data protection regulations</li><li>Enables secure API integrations and third-party services</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>SSL and TLS are different protocols, though often used interchangeably</li><li>Free certificates provide the same encryption as paid ones</li><li>SSL doesn't protect against all security threats, only data in transit</li><li>HTTPS doesn't guarantee a website is trustworthy or malware-free</li></ul>",
