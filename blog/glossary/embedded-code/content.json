  "term": "Embedded Code",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Embedded code refers to HTML, CSS, or JavaScript snippets that can be inserted directly into webpages to display interactive content, widgets, or functionality from external applications. This allows documentation teams to seamlessly integrate dynamic elements like forms, videos, demos, or third-party tools without building custom solutions from scratch.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Embedded code serves as a bridge between documentation platforms and external applications, enabling teams to enhance their content with interactive elements and dynamic functionality. This integration method allows documentation professionals to incorporate sophisticated features without requiring extensive development resources.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Direct integration through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript snippets</li><li>Real-time content updates from source applications</li><li>Responsive design compatibility across devices</li><li>Minimal impact on page loading performance</li><li>Cross-platform compatibility with most documentation systems</li><li>Customizable appearance and behavior through parameters</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces development time and technical complexity</li><li>Enables interactive demonstrations and tutorials</li><li>Maintains content freshness through automatic updates</li><li>Improves user engagement with dynamic elements</li><li>Provides seamless user experience without page redirects</li><li>Supports integration with popular tools like calendars, forms, and media players</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Embedded code always slows down page performance significantly</li><li>Only developers can implement embedded code solutions</li><li>All embedded content poses security risks to documentation sites</li><li>Embedded elements cannot be customized to match brand guidelines</li></ul>",
