    "quick_definition": "Prototyping Documentation is the systematic recording and documentation of iterative design and testing processes used to create early versions of products, validating concepts and functionality before full development. It captures design decisions, user feedback, testing results, and refinements throughout the prototyping lifecycle. This documentation serves as a critical knowledge base for development teams and stakeholders to understand the evolution of product concepts.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Prototyping Documentation encompasses the comprehensive recording of all activities, decisions, and outcomes during the product prototyping phase. It serves as a vital bridge between initial concept development and final product implementation, ensuring that valuable insights and learnings are preserved throughout the iterative design process.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Iterative design tracking with version control and change logs</li><li>User testing results and feedback compilation</li><li>Technical specifications and constraint documentation</li><li>Decision rationale and trade-off analysis</li><li>Visual documentation including wireframes, mockups, and prototypes</li><li>Stakeholder feedback integration and response tracking</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Creates a comprehensive knowledge repository for future reference</li><li>Facilitates better collaboration between design, development, and product teams</li><li>Reduces knowledge loss when team members transition</li><li>Provides clear audit trails for design decisions and changes</li><li>Enables faster onboarding of new team members</li><li>Supports post-launch analysis and improvement initiatives</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Believing prototyping documentation is only needed for complex products</li><li>Assuming informal notes are sufficient for capturing prototype insights</li><li>Thinking documentation slows down the rapid prototyping process</li><li>Expecting one-time documentation instead of continuous updates</li></ul>",
