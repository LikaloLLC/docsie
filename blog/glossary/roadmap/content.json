    "quick_definition": "A roadmap is a strategic document that outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and timeline for documentation projects and initiatives. It serves as a communication tool that aligns stakeholders on what documentation needs to be created, updated, or improved over time. For documentation teams, roadmaps provide clarity on resource allocation and help prioritize work based on business objectives and user needs.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A documentation roadmap is a strategic planning tool that provides a visual timeline of documentation initiatives, priorities, and deliverables. It serves as both a planning framework and communication vehicle that helps documentation teams align their work with broader business objectives and user requirements.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Timeline visualization showing short-term and long-term documentation goals</li><li>Priority ranking system for different documentation projects</li><li>Resource allocation mapping for team capacity planning</li><li>Milestone tracking with clear deliverables and deadlines</li><li>Stakeholder alignment mechanism ensuring everyone understands priorities</li><li>Flexibility to adapt to changing business needs and user feedback</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides clear direction and prevents scope creep in documentation projects</li><li>Improves resource planning and workload distribution across team members</li><li>Enhances stakeholder communication and expectation management</li><li>Enables data-driven decision making for documentation priorities</li><li>Facilitates better coordination between documentation and product development cycles</li><li>Creates accountability through visible progress tracking</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Roadmaps are rigid plans that cannot be changed once created</li><li>Only large documentation teams need roadmaps for effective planning</li><li>Roadmaps should include every minor documentation task and update</li><li>Technical details belong in roadmaps rather than high-level strategic initiatives</li></ul>",
