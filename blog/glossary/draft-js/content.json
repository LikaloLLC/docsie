    "quick_definition": "Draft.js is a rich text editor framework built by Facebook for React applications that provides immutable state management and extensible text editing capabilities. It enables developers to create customizable WYSIWYG editors with features like inline styling, entity handling, and plugin architecture for documentation platforms.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Draft.js is a powerful rich text editor framework developed by Facebook specifically for React applications. It provides an immutable model with a functional approach to text editing, making it ideal for building sophisticated documentation tools and content management systems.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Immutable editor state that prevents data corruption and enables undo/redo functionality</li><li>Extensible architecture with support for custom entities, decorators, and plugins</li><li>Built-in support for inline styles, block-level formatting, and nested lists</li><li>Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features for improved user experience</li><li>Server-side rendering compatibility for better SEO and performance</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Consistent editing experience across different browsers and devices</li><li>Easy integration with existing React-based documentation platforms</li><li>Customizable toolbar and formatting options tailored to documentation needs</li><li>Support for complex content structures like code blocks, tables, and media embeds</li><li>Version control friendly output with structured data representation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Draft.js is not a drop-in WYSIWYG editor but a framework requiring development work</li><li>It doesn't automatically handle all text formatting - custom styling logic is often needed</li><li>The learning curve can be steep for teams without React experience</li><li>Performance optimization may be required for large documents or complex formatting</li></ul>",
