    "quick_definition": "Tutorial Documentation is learning-oriented content that teaches users fundamental concepts and skills through structured, hands-on exercises. It guides learners step-by-step through practical tasks, helping them build competency while achieving specific learning objectives in a controlled environment.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Tutorial Documentation serves as the foundation for user education, providing structured learning experiences that combine theoretical knowledge with practical application. Unlike reference materials or how-to guides, tutorials focus on teaching core concepts through guided practice sessions.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Step-by-step progression from basic to advanced concepts</li><li>Hands-on exercises with expected outcomes</li><li>Learning objectives clearly defined at the beginning</li><li>Safe practice environment with sample data or scenarios</li><li>Progressive skill building with each lesson</li><li>Interactive elements and checkpoints for validation</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces support ticket volume by educating users proactively</li><li>Improves user onboarding and time-to-value metrics</li><li>Creates standardized learning paths for consistent user experiences</li><li>Enables scalable knowledge transfer without direct training sessions</li><li>Builds user confidence through structured skill development</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Tutorials are the same as how-to guides (tutorials teach, guides solve specific problems)</li><li>One comprehensive tutorial can replace multiple focused lessons</li><li>Tutorials should cover every possible feature or scenario</li><li>Advanced users don't need tutorial content</li></ul>",
