        "description": "Successful automated compliance monitoring requires identifying and connecting to all relevant regulatory sources that impact your documentation. This includes primary regulatory bodies, industry associations, standards organizations, and customer-specific requirements.",
        "do": "Create a comprehensive inventory of all regulatory sources, prioritize them by impact level, and regularly review source coverage to ensure no critical updates are missed.",
        "dont": "Rely solely on major regulatory bodies while ignoring industry-specific standards, regional variations, or customer-specific compliance requirements that may affect your documentation."

        "title": "Implement Intelligent Content Mapping",
        "description": "Effective compliance monitoring depends on accurately mapping regulatory requirements to specific documentation sections. This ensures alerts are targeted and actionable rather than generic notifications.",
        "do": "Use metadata tagging, content categorization, and AI-powered analysis to create precise mappings between regulations and documentation sections, updating these mappings as content evolves.",
        "dont": "Create overly broad mappings that generate excessive false alerts, or overly narrow mappings that miss important compliance impacts on related documentation."

        "do": "Define clear roles and responsibilities for different types of compliance changes, customize alert preferences by role, and establish escalation procedures for high-priority updates.",
        "dont": "Send all compliance alerts to everyone on the team, or rely on a single person to filter and distribute compliance notifications to appropriate team members."
