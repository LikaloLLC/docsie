        "solution": "Create a knowledge capture system that regularly extracts insights from customer support interactions and integrates them into documentation workflows.",
        "implementation": "1. Analyze support ticket patterns to identify recurring issues and knowledge gaps. 2. Conduct regular debriefing sessions with support agents to capture insights. 3. Document common troubleshooting procedures and customer workarounds. 4. Create user-friendly explanations for technical issues based on support experiences. 5. Develop templates for capturing new issues and solutions as they arise. 6. Establish a review process to validate and approve captured knowledge. 7. Update existing documentation based on support insights and user feedback.",
        "outcome": "More accurate and user-focused documentation, reduced support workload through better self-service resources, improved customer satisfaction, and continuous documentation improvement based on real user needs."
