    "quick_definition": "REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a web service architecture that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to enable communication between different software systems. It follows specific principles like statelessness and uniform interface, making it ideal for integrating documentation platforms with other tools and services.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>REST API is an architectural style for designing web services that enables seamless communication between different software applications using standard HTTP protocols. For documentation professionals, REST APIs serve as the backbone for integrating documentation platforms with content management systems, version control tools, and analytics platforms.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Stateless communication - each request contains all necessary information</li><li>Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations</li><li>Resource-based URLs that clearly identify data endpoints</li><li>JSON or XML data formats for easy parsing and manipulation</li><li>Cacheable responses to improve performance and reduce server load</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Automated content synchronization between multiple platforms and tools</li><li>Real-time integration with project management and development workflows</li><li>Scalable architecture that grows with documentation needs</li><li>Standardized approach reduces learning curve for team members</li><li>Enhanced collaboration through seamless data sharing across systems</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>REST APIs are not the same as SOAP APIs - REST is simpler and more flexible</li><li>Authentication is not built-in - security measures must be implemented separately</li><li>Not all web APIs are RESTful - true REST follows specific architectural constraints</li><li>REST doesn't require JSON - it can work with various data formats</li></ul>",
