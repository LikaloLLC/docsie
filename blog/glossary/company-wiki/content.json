    "quick_definition": "A company wiki is an internal knowledge-sharing platform that enables employees to collaboratively create, edit, and maintain organizational information, procedures, and documentation. It serves as a centralized repository where teams can document processes, share expertise, and ensure institutional knowledge is preserved and accessible to all relevant stakeholders.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A company wiki represents a collaborative approach to organizational knowledge management, functioning as a living repository where employees across departments can contribute, update, and access critical business information. Unlike traditional documentation methods, company wikis leverage collective intelligence to maintain current and comprehensive organizational knowledge.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Collaborative editing capabilities allowing multiple contributors</li><li>Version control and revision history tracking</li><li>Search functionality across all documented content</li><li>User permission controls and access management</li><li>Integration with existing business tools and workflows</li><li>Template systems for standardized documentation formats</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces documentation bottlenecks by distributing authoring responsibilities</li><li>Ensures knowledge retention when team members leave</li><li>Improves information accuracy through peer review and updates</li><li>Accelerates onboarding processes for new employees</li><li>Creates transparency in organizational processes and decisions</li><li>Enables real-time updates reflecting current business practices</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Belief that wikis require minimal maintenance - they need active governance</li><li>Assumption that all employees will naturally contribute quality content</li><li>Expectation that wikis replace formal documentation processes entirely</li><li>Misconception that technical complexity makes wikis unsuitable for non-technical teams</li></ul>",
