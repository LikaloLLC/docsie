    "quick_definition": "HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety that identifies physical, chemical, and biological hazards in food production processes. For documentation professionals, HACCP principles can be adapted to create comprehensive safety and quality documentation systems. It provides a structured framework for documenting critical control points, monitoring procedures, and corrective actions in food-related processes.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a science-based, systematic approach originally developed for food safety that documentation professionals can leverage to create robust documentation systems for food industry clients. This methodology focuses on preventing hazards rather than relying solely on end-product testing.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Seven fundamental principles including hazard analysis, critical control point identification, and monitoring procedures</li><li>Preventive approach that addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards</li><li>Systematic documentation requirements for all processes and control measures</li><li>Continuous monitoring and verification protocols</li><li>Corrective action procedures when critical limits are exceeded</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides structured framework for creating comprehensive food safety documentation</li><li>Ensures regulatory compliance with FDA, USDA, and international food safety standards</li><li>Creates clear audit trails and accountability measures</li><li>Standardizes documentation processes across multiple food industry clients</li><li>Reduces liability through systematic hazard prevention documentation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>HACCP is not just a checklist but requires ongoing monitoring and documentation</li><li>It's not only for large food manufacturers - small operations also benefit from HACCP documentation</li><li>HACCP doesn't replace good manufacturing practices but builds upon them</li><li>Documentation requirements are not optional but legally mandated in many jurisdictions</li></ul>",
