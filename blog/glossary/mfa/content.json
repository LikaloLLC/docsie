  "term": "MFA",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account or system. For documentation teams, MFA adds critical layers of protection to sensitive content management systems, knowledge bases, and collaborative platforms. It typically combines something you know (password), something you have (phone/token), and something you are (biometric).",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an essential security protocol that requires users to verify their identity through multiple independent credentials before accessing documentation systems. This layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive technical documentation, internal knowledge bases, and collaborative writing platforms.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Multiple verification layers including passwords, SMS codes, authenticator apps, and biometric data</li><li>Integration with popular documentation platforms and content management systems</li><li>Adaptive authentication that adjusts security requirements based on user behavior and location</li><li>Single sign-on (SSO) compatibility for seamless workflow integration</li><li>Administrative controls for managing team access and security policies</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Protects proprietary documentation and intellectual property from unauthorized access</li><li>Ensures compliance with industry regulations and security standards</li><li>Reduces risk of data breaches that could compromise sensitive technical information</li><li>Provides audit trails for tracking document access and modifications</li><li>Enables secure remote collaboration for distributed documentation teams</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>MFA significantly slows down daily workflows - modern implementations are designed for minimal friction</li><li>SMS-based authentication is the most secure option - authenticator apps and hardware tokens offer better protection</li><li>MFA is only necessary for large enterprises - small documentation teams also face security risks</li><li>Once implemented, MFA requires no maintenance - regular review and updates are essential</li></ul>",
