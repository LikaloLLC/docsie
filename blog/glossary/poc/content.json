    "quick_definition": "A Proof of Concept (POC) in documentation is a preliminary demonstration that validates whether a proposed documentation solution, tool, or approach will effectively address specific user needs or technical requirements. It serves as evidence-based validation before full implementation, helping teams make informed decisions about documentation strategies and investments.",
