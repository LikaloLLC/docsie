    "quick_definition": "IRIS (International Railway Industry Standard) is a quality management system standard specifically designed for the railway industry supply chain. It establishes comprehensive documentation requirements, processes, and quality controls to ensure safety, reliability, and compliance across railway suppliers and manufacturers.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>IRIS (International Railway Industry Standard) is a specialized quality management system that extends beyond traditional ISO 9001 standards to address the unique requirements of the railway industry. This standard mandates rigorous documentation practices, traceability protocols, and quality assurance processes throughout the entire railway supply chain.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Comprehensive documentation requirements for all processes and procedures</li><li>Mandatory traceability systems for components and materials</li><li>Structured risk management and safety documentation protocols</li><li>Regular audit cycles with detailed reporting requirements</li><li>Integration with existing quality management systems</li><li>Specific requirements for supplier qualification documentation</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Standardized documentation frameworks reduce inconsistencies across projects</li><li>Clear audit trails improve compliance and regulatory reporting</li><li>Structured templates and processes accelerate document creation</li><li>Enhanced collaboration through standardized documentation formats</li><li>Reduced documentation errors through systematic quality checks</li><li>Improved knowledge management and institutional memory preservation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>IRIS is not just another ISO certification but requires railway-specific expertise</li><li>Implementation doesn't require completely new documentation systems, but adaptation of existing ones</li><li>IRIS compliance is not a one-time achievement but requires ongoing maintenance and updates</li><li>The standard applies to suppliers at all levels, not just primary manufacturers</li></ul>",
