  "term": "API Endpoints",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "API endpoints are specific URLs that serve as access points where applications can send HTTP requests to interact with an API's functions or resources. Each endpoint represents a unique pathway to perform operations like retrieving data, creating records, or updating information. Documentation professionals use endpoint documentation to help developers understand how to integrate and interact with APIs effectively.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>API endpoints are the fundamental building blocks of API communication, serving as specific URLs that define where and how applications can access different functions or resources within an API system. For documentation professionals, understanding and documenting these endpoints is crucial for creating comprehensive API references that enable successful developer adoption.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Unique URL paths that correspond to specific API functions or resources</li><li>Support for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for various operations</li><li>Structured request and response formats, typically using JSON or XML</li><li>Authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access</li><li>Query parameters and path variables for customizing requests</li><li>Standardized error codes and response messages for troubleshooting</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides clear structure for organizing API documentation by functionality</li><li>Enables interactive documentation with live testing capabilities</li><li>Facilitates automated documentation generation from API specifications</li><li>Supports version control and change tracking for API evolution</li><li>Improves developer experience through consistent documentation patterns</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Endpoints are not just URLs - they include methods, parameters, and expected behaviors</li><li>Documentation should cover error scenarios, not just successful responses</li><li>Endpoint documentation requires ongoing maintenance as APIs evolve</li><li>Interactive examples are essential, not optional additions</li></ul>",
