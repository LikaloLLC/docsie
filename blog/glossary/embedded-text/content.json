  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Embedded text is content that is integrated directly into a document file as selectable, searchable text rather than as an image or graphic element. This allows users to copy, search, and interact with the text content while maintaining proper accessibility and SEO benefits.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Embedded text represents a fundamental distinction in how content is stored and presented within digital documents. Unlike text that appears as part of an image or graphic, embedded text exists as actual text data within the document structure, making it fully interactive and accessible to both users and search engines.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Text remains selectable and copyable by users</li><li>Content is searchable within the document and by search engines</li><li>Maintains proper text formatting and styling properties</li><li>Supports accessibility features like screen readers</li><li>Preserves character encoding and language attributes</li><li>Enables text-based operations like find/replace</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Improved SEO performance through searchable content</li><li>Enhanced accessibility compliance for diverse user needs</li><li>Easier content maintenance and updates without image editing</li><li>Better user experience with copy-paste functionality</li><li>Reduced file sizes compared to image-based text</li><li>Consistent formatting across different devices and platforms</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Believing that styled text automatically becomes embedded (formatting can still be image-based)</li><li>Assuming all PDF text is embedded (some PDFs contain flattened image text)</li><li>Thinking embedded text limits design flexibility (modern tools offer extensive styling options)</li><li>Confusing embedded text with embedded objects or media files</li></ul>",
