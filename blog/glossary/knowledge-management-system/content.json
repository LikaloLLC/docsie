    "quick_definition": "A Knowledge Management System is a technology platform that captures, organizes, and shares an organization's collective knowledge to improve decision-making and operational efficiency. It serves as a centralized repository where teams can store, search, and collaborate on institutional knowledge, best practices, and documentation.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A Knowledge Management System (KMS) is a comprehensive technology solution designed to capture, organize, store, and distribute an organization's collective knowledge and information assets. For documentation professionals, it serves as the backbone for creating, maintaining, and sharing knowledge across teams and departments.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Centralized content repository with version control</li><li>Advanced search and discovery capabilities</li><li>Collaborative editing and review workflows</li><li>Integration with existing tools and platforms</li><li>Analytics and usage tracking</li><li>Role-based access controls and permissions</li><li>Automated content classification and tagging</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces content duplication and inconsistencies</li><li>Improves knowledge retention and transfer</li><li>Accelerates onboarding and training processes</li><li>Enhances cross-team collaboration</li><li>Provides insights into content usage and gaps</li><li>Streamlines compliance and audit processes</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>KMS is just a fancy file storage system</li><li>Implementation requires complete workflow overhaul</li><li>Only large organizations benefit from KMS</li><li>KMS replaces the need for documentation standards</li><li>Success depends solely on technology, not adoption</li></ul>",
