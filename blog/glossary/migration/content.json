  "term": "Migration",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Migration in documentation refers to the systematic process of transferring content, data, and assets from one documentation platform, format, or system to another. This process typically occurs during software upgrades, platform changes, or organizational restructuring to ensure continuity and accessibility of critical documentation resources.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Migration is a critical process for documentation teams involving the systematic transfer of content, metadata, user permissions, and workflows from one documentation system to another. This process ensures business continuity while enabling teams to leverage new features, improved performance, or better integration capabilities.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Content preservation with formatting and structure integrity</li><li>Metadata and taxonomy transfer including tags, categories, and relationships</li><li>User permission and access control migration</li><li>Version history and audit trail maintenance</li><li>Asset migration including images, videos, and attachments</li><li>URL structure preservation for SEO and bookmarking</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Eliminates manual content recreation, saving significant time and resources</li><li>Maintains historical context and version control across platforms</li><li>Preserves SEO rankings and external link integrity</li><li>Enables access to advanced features and improved user experiences</li><li>Reduces risk of content loss during platform transitions</li><li>Facilitates better collaboration and workflow optimization</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Migration is a simple copy-paste operation requiring minimal planning</li><li>All content formats will transfer perfectly without any adjustments needed</li><li>Migration can be completed instantly without testing or validation phases</li><li>User training is unnecessary if the new platform has similar features</li></ul>",

        "solution": "Consolidate all documentation sources into a single, centralized platform with unified search and navigation.",
        "implementation": "1. Inventory all documentation sources and content types\n2. Establish content taxonomy and organization structure\n3. Prioritize content by importance and usage frequency\n4. Migrate high-priority content first with proper categorization\n5. Implement content governance policies\n6. Decommission old platforms gradually",
        "outcome": "Centralized knowledge base with 60% reduction in time spent searching for information and improved content governance leading to higher quality documentation."

        "title": "Implement Phased Migration Approach",
