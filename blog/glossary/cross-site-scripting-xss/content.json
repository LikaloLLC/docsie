  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. For documentation teams, understanding XSS is crucial for protecting user-generated content, comments, and interactive documentation features from script injection attacks.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) represents one of the most prevalent web security vulnerabilities that documentation professionals must understand and guard against. This vulnerability occurs when malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites and executed in users' browsers, potentially compromising sensitive information and user experience.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Script injection through user input fields, comments, or search functionality</li><li>Three main types: Stored XSS (persistent), Reflected XSS (non-persistent), and DOM-based XSS</li><li>Execution of malicious code in the context of the trusted website</li><li>Ability to steal cookies, session tokens, and sensitive user data</li><li>Potential for defacing websites or redirecting users to malicious sites</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enhanced security awareness when implementing interactive features like comments or feedback forms</li><li>Better understanding of input validation requirements for documentation platforms</li><li>Improved ability to collaborate with security teams on documentation site protection</li><li>Knowledge to make informed decisions about third-party integrations and plugins</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Believing that static documentation sites are immune to XSS attacks</li><li>Assuming that client-side validation alone prevents XSS vulnerabilities</li><li>Thinking that XSS only affects the individual user who encounters the malicious script</li><li>Underestimating the impact of XSS on documentation site credibility and user trust</li></ul>",
