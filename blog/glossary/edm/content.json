    "quick_definition": "Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a precision manufacturing process that uses controlled electrical sparks to cut and shape hard metals and conductive materials. For documentation professionals, understanding EDM is crucial when creating technical manuals, safety procedures, and process documentation for manufacturing environments where precision machining is required.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a non-traditional manufacturing process that removes material through controlled electrical discharges between an electrode and workpiece. Documentation professionals working with manufacturing clients must understand EDM processes to create accurate technical content, safety protocols, and operational procedures.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Uses electrical sparks instead of physical cutting tools</li><li>Achieves extremely tight tolerances (\u00b10.0001 inches)</li><li>Works only with electrically conductive materials</li><li>Operates in a dielectric fluid environment</li><li>Produces no mechanical cutting forces</li><li>Can create complex internal geometries</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Requires detailed safety documentation due to electrical hazards</li><li>Demands precise procedural documentation for quality control</li><li>Needs comprehensive troubleshooting guides for complex equipment</li><li>Creates opportunities for visual documentation of intricate processes</li><li>Generates need for multi-language technical translations</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>EDM is not faster than conventional machining for simple parts</li><li>Cannot be used on non-conductive materials like plastics or ceramics</li><li>Does not require post-processing - surface finishing is often needed</li><li>Is not suitable for high-volume production runs</li></ul>",
