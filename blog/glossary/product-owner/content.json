    "quick_definition": "A Product Owner is an agile role responsible for defining product requirements, prioritizing features, and representing stakeholder needs to development teams. In documentation contexts, they bridge the gap between user needs and content strategy, ensuring documentation delivers maximum value. They make critical decisions about what documentation gets created, updated, or retired based on user feedback and business priorities.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A Product Owner serves as the crucial link between stakeholders and development teams, making strategic decisions about product direction and feature prioritization. In documentation teams, this role adapts to focus on content strategy, user experience, and information architecture decisions.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Defines and maintains the product backlog with prioritized documentation tasks</li><li>Serves as the single point of contact for stakeholder requirements and feedback</li><li>Makes decisions about content scope, format, and delivery methods</li><li>Collaborates with technical writers, developers, and UX designers</li><li>Validates documentation solutions against user needs and business objectives</li><li>Manages trade-offs between competing documentation priorities</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides clear direction and eliminates ambiguity in content priorities</li><li>Ensures documentation aligns with actual user needs and business goals</li><li>Streamlines decision-making processes and reduces bottlenecks</li><li>Improves stakeholder communication and expectation management</li><li>Enables data-driven content strategy based on user feedback and analytics</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Product Owners are not project managers - they focus on 'what' and 'why', not 'how' and 'when'</li><li>They don't write documentation themselves but guide content strategy and priorities</li><li>The role requires deep user empathy, not just technical knowledge</li><li>Success is measured by user outcomes, not just delivery of documentation features</li></ul>",
