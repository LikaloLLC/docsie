    "quick_definition": "Operational Qualification (OQ) is a validation study that verifies equipment, systems, or processes operate correctly within specified parameters and function as intended. In documentation contexts, OQ ensures that documentation tools, workflows, and systems perform reliably under normal operating conditions. It's a critical step in the validation process that bridges installation qualification and performance qualification.",
