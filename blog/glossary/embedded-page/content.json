  "term": "Embedded Page",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "An embedded page is a web page or content that is integrated directly into another website or platform using HTML code, typically through iframes or embed scripts. This allows documentation teams to display external content seamlessly within their existing systems without redirecting users to different domains. Embedded pages maintain the host site's navigation and branding while presenting integrated content from various sources.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>An embedded page represents a powerful integration method that allows documentation teams to incorporate external web content directly into their platforms without disrupting the user experience. This technique uses HTML embedding technologies to display content from one source within the context of another website or application.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Seamless integration using iframe, embed tags, or JavaScript widgets</li><li>Maintains host site's navigation, branding, and user interface</li><li>Cross-domain content display without page redirects</li><li>Responsive design compatibility for various screen sizes</li><li>Real-time content updates from source without manual intervention</li><li>Customizable dimensions and styling options</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces content duplication by referencing single source of truth</li><li>Enables integration of specialized tools like interactive demos or calculators</li><li>Maintains consistent user experience across different content types</li><li>Simplifies content management by centralizing updates</li><li>Allows incorporation of third-party documentation without migration</li><li>Supports modular documentation architecture</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Embedded pages always slow down site performance significantly</li><li>All embedded content requires complex technical implementation</li><li>Embedded pages cannot be optimized for search engines</li><li>Security risks are unavoidable with embedded content</li><li>Mobile responsiveness is automatically compromised</li></ul>",
