    "quick_definition": "API Reference Docs are comprehensive technical documentation that provides detailed information about API endpoints, methods, parameters, request/response formats, and authentication requirements. They serve as the primary resource for developers to understand and integrate with an API effectively.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>API Reference Docs are essential technical documentation that serves as the complete guide for developers working with Application Programming Interfaces. These documents provide exhaustive details about every aspect of an API, from endpoint URLs to data structures and error handling.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Detailed endpoint documentation with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li><li>Parameter specifications including data types, required/optional status, and validation rules</li><li>Request and response examples with actual code samples</li><li>Authentication and authorization requirements</li><li>Error codes and troubleshooting information</li><li>Rate limiting and usage guidelines</li><li>Interactive testing capabilities</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces support tickets by providing comprehensive self-service resources</li><li>Accelerates developer onboarding and integration timelines</li><li>Ensures consistency across all API documentation</li><li>Enables automated documentation generation from code annotations</li><li>Facilitates better collaboration between development and documentation teams</li><li>Improves API adoption rates through clear, accessible information</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>That API docs are only for external developers - internal teams benefit equally</li><li>That auto-generated docs are sufficient without human review and enhancement</li><li>That technical accuracy is more important than usability and clarity</li><li>That API reference docs don't need regular updates after initial publication</li></ul>",
