    "quick_definition": "FDA QSR (Quality System Regulation) is a comprehensive regulatory framework established by the Food and Drug Administration that mandates specific documentation, design controls, and quality management practices for medical device manufacturers. It requires detailed documentation of all processes, procedures, and controls throughout the device lifecycle to ensure safety and effectiveness.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>The FDA Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820) serves as the cornerstone regulatory framework governing medical device manufacturing in the United States. This regulation establishes mandatory requirements for quality systems, documentation practices, and process controls that medical device companies must implement and maintain throughout their operations.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Design controls requiring documented design and development processes</li><li>Document control systems with version management and approval workflows</li><li>Corrective and preventive action (CAPA) documentation requirements</li><li>Management responsibility documentation including quality policies and procedures</li><li>Production and process controls with detailed work instructions</li><li>Records management systems for traceability and compliance</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Standardized documentation frameworks that improve consistency across projects</li><li>Clear audit trails and version control requirements that enhance accountability</li><li>Structured review and approval processes that ensure document quality</li><li>Risk management documentation that supports informed decision-making</li><li>Training record requirements that promote team competency</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>QSR only applies to high-risk devices - it actually covers most medical devices</li><li>Documentation can be informal - QSR requires formal, controlled documentation</li><li>QSR is only for manufacturing - it covers the entire product lifecycle including design</li><li>Compliance is one-time - QSR requires ongoing maintenance and updates</li></ul>",
