    "quick_definition": "Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites and web applications. It follows the 'batteries-included' philosophy, providing built-in features like authentication, database management, and URL routing. Documentation teams often use Django to build custom documentation portals, content management systems, and API documentation platforms.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Django is a powerful Python web framework designed to help developers build robust web applications quickly and efficiently. Created with the principle of 'don't repeat yourself' (DRY), Django provides a comprehensive toolkit for web development while maintaining clean, pragmatic design principles.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture for organized code structure</li><li>Built-in admin interface for content management</li><li>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database interactions</li><li>Automatic URL routing and template engine</li><li>Built-in security features including CSRF protection and SQL injection prevention</li><li>Scalable architecture supporting high-traffic applications</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Rapid prototyping of custom documentation platforms and portals</li><li>Easy integration with existing Python-based documentation tools</li><li>Built-in user authentication and permission systems for private documentation</li><li>Flexible content management capabilities for dynamic documentation</li><li>RESTful API development for documentation data exchange</li><li>Strong community support and extensive third-party packages</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Django is not just for large applications - it works well for small documentation projects</li><li>You don't need to be a Python expert to start using Django effectively</li><li>Django doesn't require complex server setups - it can run on simple hosting platforms</li><li>It's not overkill for documentation sites - the admin interface alone can be valuable</li></ul>",
