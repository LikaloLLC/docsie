    "quick_definition": "International Joint Ventures (IJVs) are strategic business partnerships between companies from different countries that collaborate on specific projects, markets, or initiatives. For documentation professionals, IJVs create complex multi-cultural, multi-lingual documentation requirements that span different regulatory environments, business practices, and stakeholder groups across international boundaries.",
