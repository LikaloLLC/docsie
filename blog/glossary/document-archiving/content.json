  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Document archiving is the systematic process of storing older or outdated documents in a structured repository for long-term preservation and future reference while removing them from active workflows. This practice maintains document accessibility for compliance, historical reference, and knowledge preservation while keeping current workspaces organized and efficient.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Document archiving is a critical information management practice that enables documentation teams to maintain organized, efficient workspaces while preserving valuable historical content. This systematic approach involves identifying, categorizing, and storing documents that are no longer actively used but may need to be referenced in the future.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Systematic storage and categorization of inactive documents</li><li>Retention policies that define how long documents should be preserved</li><li>Search and retrieval capabilities for archived content</li><li>Version control and metadata preservation</li><li>Access controls and security measures for sensitive archived materials</li><li>Integration with active documentation workflows</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Improved performance and reduced clutter in active documentation systems</li><li>Compliance with regulatory requirements and legal obligations</li><li>Preservation of institutional knowledge and historical context</li><li>Cost optimization through efficient storage management</li><li>Enhanced searchability and discoverability of past content</li><li>Streamlined maintenance and updates of current documentation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Archived documents are permanently deleted or inaccessible</li><li>Archiving is only necessary for legal or compliance purposes</li><li>All old documents should be archived regardless of their value</li><li>Archiving is a one-time activity rather than an ongoing process</li></ul>",
