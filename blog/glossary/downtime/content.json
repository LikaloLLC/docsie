  "term": "Downtime",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Downtime refers to periods when documentation systems, tools, or processes are unavailable or non-operational, preventing teams from creating, updating, or accessing critical content. It's a key metric for measuring documentation infrastructure reliability and team productivity impact.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Downtime in documentation contexts encompasses any period when documentation systems, tools, or workflows become unavailable or cease to function properly. This includes server outages, software failures, maintenance windows, and process breakdowns that prevent documentation teams from performing their essential tasks.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Measurable impact on team productivity and content accessibility</li><li>Can be planned (maintenance) or unplanned (system failures)</li><li>Affects both content creation and content consumption</li><li>Often measured in minutes, hours, or percentage of total operational time</li><li>Cascades through dependent systems and workflows</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Tracking downtime helps identify system reliability issues and improvement opportunities</li><li>Enables better resource planning and backup strategy development</li><li>Provides data for SLA negotiations and vendor accountability</li><li>Helps justify investments in more robust documentation infrastructure</li><li>Improves incident response and recovery procedures</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Only applies to major system outages, not minor workflow disruptions</li><li>Can be completely eliminated with proper planning</li><li>Only affects technical documentation teams</li><li>Is solely an IT department responsibility</li></ul>",
