    "quick_definition": "Customer retention is the ability of a company to keep its existing customers over a specified period, typically measured as a percentage of customers who continue using the service. For documentation teams, it involves creating and maintaining content that keeps users engaged and prevents them from seeking alternative solutions. High retention rates indicate that documentation successfully meets user needs and provides ongoing value.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Customer retention represents a critical metric for businesses, measuring how effectively they maintain their customer base over time. For documentation teams, retention directly correlates with how well their content serves users' ongoing needs and prevents churn to competitor solutions.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Retention rate calculation: (Customers at end of period - New customers) / Customers at start of period \u00d7 100</li><li>Time-based measurement periods (monthly, quarterly, annually)</li><li>Segmentation by customer type, product usage, or engagement level</li><li>Cohort analysis to track specific customer groups over time</li><li>Churn identification and prevention strategies</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Demonstrates direct business impact of documentation quality</li><li>Identifies content gaps that lead to customer dissatisfaction</li><li>Guides resource allocation toward high-impact documentation areas</li><li>Enables data-driven content strategy decisions</li><li>Helps justify documentation team investments and headcount</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Retention is solely a sales or customer success responsibility, not documentation</li><li>High initial adoption automatically translates to long-term retention</li><li>Retention metrics are only relevant for subscription-based businesses</li><li>Documentation quality has minimal impact on customer retention rates</li></ul>",
