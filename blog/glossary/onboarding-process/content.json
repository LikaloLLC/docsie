    "quick_definition": "The onboarding process is a structured approach to introducing new users to documentation, products, or services, guiding them through initial setup and core features. It helps users quickly understand how to navigate, find information, and achieve their goals while reducing time-to-value and support requests.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>The onboarding process in documentation is a strategic framework designed to transform new users from confused newcomers into confident, productive participants. It serves as the critical bridge between a user's first interaction and their successful adoption of your documentation system or product.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Progressive disclosure of information, starting with essential concepts</li><li>Interactive tutorials and guided walkthroughs</li><li>Contextual help and tooltips at decision points</li><li>Milestone tracking and progress indicators</li><li>Personalized content paths based on user roles or goals</li><li>Integration with support channels for immediate assistance</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduced support ticket volume through proactive guidance</li><li>Improved user satisfaction and retention rates</li><li>Better analytics on user behavior and pain points</li><li>Standardized introduction process across all user segments</li><li>Enhanced product adoption and feature discovery</li><li>Clear success metrics for documentation effectiveness</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Onboarding is just a one-time welcome message or tour</li><li>More information upfront always leads to better outcomes</li><li>The same onboarding works for all user types and skill levels</li><li>Onboarding ends after the first session or week</li></ul>",
