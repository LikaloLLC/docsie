    "quick_definition": "Customer onboarding is the structured process of guiding new users through initial product setup, training, and feature familiarization using documentation, tutorials, and support materials. It ensures customers can successfully adopt and derive value from a product or service from their first interaction. Effective onboarding reduces time-to-value and increases long-term customer retention.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Customer onboarding is a critical process that transforms new users into successful, engaged customers through strategic guidance and educational resources. For documentation teams, this involves creating comprehensive materials that support users throughout their initial journey with a product or service.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Progressive disclosure of information based on user needs and experience level</li><li>Multi-format content delivery including tutorials, videos, interactive guides, and FAQs</li><li>Milestone-based learning paths that track user progress</li><li>Contextual help and just-in-time information delivery</li><li>Feedback collection mechanisms to improve the onboarding experience</li><li>Integration with product interfaces for seamless user experience</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces support ticket volume by proactively addressing common questions</li><li>Provides clear metrics on content effectiveness and user engagement</li><li>Creates reusable content frameworks that scale with product growth</li><li>Improves cross-team collaboration between documentation, product, and customer success</li><li>Establishes documentation as a revenue-driving function through improved retention</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Onboarding is only about initial setup rather than ongoing value realization</li><li>One-size-fits-all approaches work for all customer segments</li><li>Onboarding ends after the first week or month of product usage</li><li>Technical documentation alone is sufficient without considering user psychology</li></ul>",
