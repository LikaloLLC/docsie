    "quick_definition": "JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are compact, URL-safe tokens that securely transmit information between parties as digitally signed JSON objects. They consist of three parts (header, payload, signature) and are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. JWTs are stateless, self-contained, and can be verified without requiring server-side session storage.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standardized method for securely transmitting information between parties as a compact, URL-safe string. Each token contains encoded JSON data that can be verified and trusted because it's digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Three-part structure: header (algorithm and token type), payload (claims and data), and signature (verification)</li><li>Stateless authentication that doesn't require server-side session storage</li><li>Self-contained tokens that carry all necessary information within them</li><li>URL-safe encoding that works across different systems and protocols</li><li>Configurable expiration times for enhanced security</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Simplified user authentication across multiple documentation platforms and tools</li><li>Secure API access for automated documentation generation and updates</li><li>Seamless single sign-on (SSO) integration for team collaboration</li><li>Role-based access control for sensitive documentation content</li><li>Reduced server load through stateless authentication mechanisms</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>JWTs are not encrypted by default - they're only encoded and signed for integrity</li><li>Tokens should not store sensitive data in the payload as it's easily readable</li><li>JWTs cannot be revoked easily once issued, unlike traditional sessions</li><li>They're not always the best choice for every authentication scenario</li></ul>",
