  "term": "Open Redirect",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Open Redirect is a web application vulnerability that allows attackers to redirect users from legitimate application URLs to malicious external websites. This security flaw occurs when applications accept user-controlled input to determine redirect destinations without proper validation. Documentation teams must understand this vulnerability to properly document secure redirect implementations and warn developers about potential risks.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Open Redirect vulnerabilities represent a critical security concern for web applications, occurring when user-controlled input determines redirect destinations without proper validation. Documentation teams play a crucial role in helping developers understand and prevent these vulnerabilities through comprehensive security documentation.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>URL manipulation through user-controlled parameters</li><li>Legitimate domain appearance masking malicious redirects</li><li>Potential for phishing and social engineering attacks</li><li>Often exploited in password reset and login flows</li><li>Can bypass domain-based security filters</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enhanced security awareness in technical documentation</li><li>Improved developer education on secure coding practices</li><li>Better API documentation with security considerations</li><li>Comprehensive security testing procedures documentation</li><li>Clear vulnerability remediation guidelines</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Belief that redirects to external domains are always safe</li><li>Assumption that HTTPS prevents open redirect exploitation</li><li>Thinking that URL validation is unnecessary for trusted applications</li><li>Misconception that open redirects are low-severity vulnerabilities</li><li>Belief that client-side validation alone prevents exploitation</li></ul>",
