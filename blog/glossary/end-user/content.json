    "quick_definition": "An end-user is the final person who uses a product or service, as opposed to the developers, administrators, or technical stakeholders who create or maintain it. In documentation, end-users are the primary audience who consume help content, guides, and tutorials to accomplish their goals. Understanding end-user needs is crucial for creating effective, user-centered documentation.",
