    "quick_definition": "UX Documentation is a collection of strategic documents that capture and communicate user experience design decisions, including user personas, wireframes, prototypes, and style guidelines. It serves as a bridge between user research, design teams, and development, ensuring consistent user-centered experiences across products and features.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>UX Documentation encompasses all written and visual materials that capture user experience design decisions, research insights, and design specifications. It serves as the authoritative source of truth for how users interact with products and ensures design consistency across teams and projects.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>User personas and journey maps that define target audiences and their behaviors</li><li>Wireframes and prototypes showing interface layouts and interactions</li><li>Design systems and style guides ensuring visual consistency</li><li>Usability testing reports and user research findings</li><li>Information architecture diagrams and navigation structures</li><li>Accessibility guidelines and compliance documentation</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Creates shared understanding between design, development, and product teams</li><li>Reduces design inconsistencies and implementation errors</li><li>Accelerates onboarding for new team members</li><li>Provides historical context for design decisions</li><li>Enables scalable design processes across multiple products</li><li>Improves collaboration between technical writers and UX designers</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>UX Documentation is only for designers - it's essential for all product stakeholders</li><li>It's just pretty pictures - it includes detailed specifications and rationale</li><li>It's created once and forgotten - it requires continuous updates and maintenance</li><li>It slows down development - proper documentation actually accelerates implementation</li></ul>",
