  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Faceted search is an advanced filtering system that allows users to narrow down documentation results using multiple categories or attributes simultaneously. It enables users to combine filters like content type, product version, topic, and difficulty level to quickly find the exact information they need.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Faceted search transforms how users navigate and discover content in documentation systems by providing multiple filtering dimensions that can be combined to create highly specific search queries. Unlike traditional keyword search, faceted search presents users with structured categories that guide them toward relevant results.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Multiple simultaneous filters across different content dimensions</li><li>Dynamic filter options that update based on available results</li><li>Visual breadcrumb navigation showing applied filters</li><li>Real-time result count updates as filters are applied</li><li>Hierarchical category structures for complex content organization</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces support ticket volume by helping users find answers faster</li><li>Improves content discoverability for specialized or niche topics</li><li>Provides analytics insights into user search patterns and content gaps</li><li>Scales effectively with large content libraries and diverse user needs</li><li>Enhances user experience through guided, intuitive navigation</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Faceted search is not just advanced filtering - it's a complete discovery system</li><li>Implementation doesn't require complex technical knowledge with modern platforms</li><li>It's beneficial for small content libraries, not just enterprise-scale documentation</li><li>Faceted search complements rather than replaces traditional keyword search</li></ul>",
