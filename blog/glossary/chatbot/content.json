    "quick_definition": "A chatbot is an AI-powered software application that simulates human conversation to provide automated customer support and answer user queries. In documentation contexts, chatbots help users find information quickly by interpreting natural language questions and providing relevant answers from knowledge bases. They serve as intelligent interfaces between users and documentation content, reducing support tickets and improving user experience.",
