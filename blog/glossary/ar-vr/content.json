    "quick_definition": "AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality) are immersive technologies that enhance documentation by overlaying digital information onto real-world environments or creating fully virtual training spaces. These technologies enable documentation professionals to create interactive, three-dimensional user guides, training materials, and support resources that users can experience hands-on rather than just read about.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>AR/VR technologies are revolutionizing how documentation teams create, deliver, and maintain user-facing content by providing immersive, interactive experiences that go beyond traditional text and images.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Real-time overlay of digital instructions onto physical objects or environments</li><li>Interactive 3D models and simulations for complex procedures</li><li>Voice-activated navigation and hands-free interaction</li><li>Multi-sensory feedback including visual, audio, and haptic elements</li><li>Contextual help that appears exactly where users need it</li><li>Recording and playback capabilities for training scenarios</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduced support tickets through clearer, more intuitive instructions</li><li>Faster user onboarding with immersive training experiences</li><li>Improved comprehension rates for complex technical procedures</li><li>Enhanced accessibility through multiple interaction modalities</li><li>Real-time content updates that sync across all AR/VR experiences</li><li>Detailed analytics on user interaction patterns and pain points</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>AR/VR documentation requires expensive hardware - many solutions work with smartphones</li><li>Implementation is too complex for small teams - user-friendly authoring tools are widely available</li><li>Content creation takes significantly longer - templates and reusable components streamline development</li><li>AR/VR is only suitable for technical products - it enhances any process-based documentation</li></ul>",
