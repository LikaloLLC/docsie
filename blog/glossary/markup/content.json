    "quick_definition": "Markup is a method of formatting text using special codes or tags to indicate how content should be displayed or structured. It allows documentation professionals to separate content from presentation, using standardized syntax like HTML, Markdown, or XML to define elements such as headings, links, code blocks, and formatting. This approach enables consistent styling and easier content management across documentation platforms.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Markup serves as the foundation of modern documentation by providing a systematic way to structure and format content using standardized codes and tags. It acts as an intermediary language between raw text and final presentation, allowing writers to focus on content while ensuring consistent formatting across all documentation outputs.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Semantic structure definition through hierarchical tags and elements</li><li>Platform-independent formatting that works across different systems</li><li>Version control compatibility for tracking changes and collaboration</li><li>Automated styling through CSS or built-in theme systems</li><li>Cross-referencing capabilities for links, images, and internal content</li><li>Code syntax highlighting and technical content formatting</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Faster content creation with reusable formatting patterns</li><li>Consistent visual presentation across all documentation pages</li><li>Easier collaboration through readable, text-based source files</li><li>Automated publishing workflows and multi-format output generation</li><li>Better SEO performance through semantic HTML structure</li><li>Reduced maintenance overhead with centralized styling</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Markup is not programming - it's a formatting and structuring language</li><li>Learning markup doesn't require technical expertise beyond basic syntax</li><li>Markup languages are designed for human readability, not just machines</li><li>Modern markup tools provide visual editors alongside code views</li></ul>",

        "solution": "Use markup languages like Markdown or HTML to create structured code blocks with language-specific formatting, inline code elements, and organized parameter tables.",
        "implementation": "1. Define code blocks using triple backticks with language identifiers\n2. Use inline code tags for variable names and short snippets\n3. Create structured tables for API parameters using markup table syntax\n4. Implement consistent heading hierarchy for different API sections\n5. Add cross-references between related API methods",

        "implementation": "1. Write content in platform-agnostic markup (Markdown or structured HTML)\n2. Set up automated build processes for different output formats\n3. Create format-specific styling templates and CSS\n4. Configure conditional content blocks for format-specific information\n5. Establish automated publishing pipelines for each target platform",

        "implementation": "1. Structure content with semantic HTML markup for accessibility\n2. Add custom data attributes for interactive behavior\n3. Create modular CSS classes for common interactive patterns\n4. Implement progressive enhancement for non-JavaScript users\n5. Test interactive elements across different devices and browsers",
