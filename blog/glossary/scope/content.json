        "implementation": "1. List all possible API documentation components. 2. Prioritize based on user needs and business impact. 3. Allocate 70% of resources to core endpoints. 4. Document exclusions clearly. 5. Create timeline for each included component. 6. Get stakeholder sign-off on scope document.",

        "implementation": "1. Audit existing documentation assets. 2. Identify current product versions and active features. 3. Define target output formats and platforms. 4. Exclude deprecated functionality and unsupported versions. 5. Create content migration priority matrix. 6. Document resource requirements for each scope element.",
