    "quick_definition": "Commits are individual snapshots of changes made to documentation files that are saved and tracked in a version control system like Git. Each commit includes a unique identifier, timestamp, author information, and a descriptive message explaining what was changed. They create a chronological history of all modifications, enabling teams to track progress, revert changes, and collaborate effectively on documentation projects.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Commits serve as the fundamental building blocks of version control in documentation workflows, capturing discrete changes to files and creating a permanent record of project evolution. Each commit represents a specific point in time when documentation was modified, reviewed, and deemed ready to be preserved in the project history.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Unique hash identifiers that distinguish each commit from others</li><li>Commit messages that describe the nature and purpose of changes</li><li>Author attribution showing who made the changes and when</li><li>File diffs that highlight exactly what content was added, modified, or deleted</li><li>Parent-child relationships that maintain chronological order</li><li>Branch integration allowing parallel development streams</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Complete audit trail of all documentation changes over time</li><li>Ability to revert to previous versions when errors are introduced</li><li>Collaborative editing with conflict resolution capabilities</li><li>Release management through tagged commits and branching strategies</li><li>Integration with review processes and approval workflows</li><li>Backup and recovery through distributed version control</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Commits are only useful for code, not documentation files</li><li>Every small change requires an immediate commit</li><li>Commit messages don't matter for documentation projects</li><li>Commits automatically sync across all team members</li><li>Version control is too complex for non-technical writers</li></ul>",
