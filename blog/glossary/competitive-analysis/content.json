    "quick_definition": "Competitive Analysis is a systematic research process where documentation teams identify and evaluate competitors' content strategies, documentation approaches, and user experience to inform their own documentation decisions. It involves analyzing competitors' strengths, weaknesses, and best practices to improve product positioning and documentation effectiveness.",
