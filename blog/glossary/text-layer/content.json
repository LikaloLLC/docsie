  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "A text layer is an invisible layer of selectable text embedded in PDF documents that enables search functionality, text selection, and accessibility features. It allows users to interact with text content in scanned documents or image-based PDFs without affecting the visual appearance. This technology is essential for making documentation searchable and accessible to users and assistive technologies.",
