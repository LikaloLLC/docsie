    "quick_definition": "Functional specifications are detailed technical documents that define a product's features, user interactions, and system behaviors before development begins. They serve as blueprints for development teams and comprehensive references for documentation professionals to create accurate user guides and technical content.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Functional specifications (often called functional specs or FRDs - Functional Requirements Documents) are comprehensive technical documents that outline what a product should do, how it should behave, and how users will interact with it. These documents bridge the gap between initial product concepts and actual development, serving as essential reference materials for documentation teams.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Detailed feature descriptions with specific behaviors and constraints</li><li>User interaction flows and interface requirements</li><li>System integration points and data flow specifications</li><li>Performance requirements and technical constraints</li><li>Error handling and edge case scenarios</li><li>Acceptance criteria for each functional requirement</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides authoritative source of truth for feature documentation</li><li>Enables early documentation planning and content strategy development</li><li>Reduces back-and-forth with development teams for clarification</li><li>Ensures consistency across all user-facing documentation</li><li>Facilitates accurate API documentation and technical guides</li><li>Supports creation of comprehensive troubleshooting resources</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Functional specs are only for developers - documentation teams benefit significantly</li><li>They're static documents - specs should evolve with product changes</li><li>Technical specs and functional specs are the same - they serve different purposes</li><li>They're unnecessary for agile development - they actually enhance agile workflows</li></ul>",
