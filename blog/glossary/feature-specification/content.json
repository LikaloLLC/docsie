    "quick_definition": "A feature specification is a detailed technical document that describes a product feature's functionality, behavior, and user value. It serves as the authoritative reference for development teams, documentation professionals, and stakeholders to understand what the feature does and how it operates. Feature specifications bridge the gap between high-level requirements and implementation details.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A feature specification is a comprehensive document that defines the complete scope, functionality, and behavior of a product feature. It serves as the single source of truth for development teams, documentation professionals, and stakeholders throughout the product development lifecycle.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Detailed functional requirements and acceptance criteria</li><li>User interaction flows and expected behaviors</li><li>Technical constraints and dependencies</li><li>Success metrics and validation criteria</li><li>Edge cases and error handling scenarios</li><li>Integration points with existing systems</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides authoritative source material for user guides and API documentation</li><li>Reduces back-and-forth communication with development teams</li><li>Ensures consistency across all documentation deliverables</li><li>Enables proactive documentation planning and resource allocation</li><li>Facilitates accurate technical writing and reduces revision cycles</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Feature specs are only for developers - documentation teams need them equally</li><li>Specifications are static documents that don't evolve during development</li><li>High-level requirements can substitute for detailed feature specifications</li><li>Feature specs are unnecessary overhead that slows down development</li></ul>",
