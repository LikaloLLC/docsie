    "quick_definition": "Validation and Test Engineer (V&TE) professionals are responsible for ensuring medical devices meet safety, efficacy, and regulatory compliance standards through rigorous testing and comprehensive documentation. They create and maintain critical documentation that demonstrates device compliance with FDA, ISO, and other regulatory requirements. V&TE professionals bridge the gap between technical testing processes and regulatory documentation needs.",
