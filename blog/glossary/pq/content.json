    "quick_definition": "Performance Qualification (PQ) is a validation protocol that demonstrates a documentation system consistently performs according to specifications under normal operating conditions. It ensures that documentation processes, tools, and workflows meet predefined performance criteria and deliver reliable results for end users.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Performance Qualification (PQ) is the final phase of system validation that verifies documentation systems perform consistently and reliably in real-world operating conditions. It goes beyond installation and operational qualification to prove that systems deliver expected results over extended periods.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Real-world testing under actual operating conditions and user loads</li><li>Measurement of system performance against predefined acceptance criteria</li><li>Documentation of consistent results over specified time periods</li><li>Validation of user workflows and documentation processes</li><li>Assessment of system reliability, availability, and maintainability</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Ensures documentation systems meet business requirements consistently</li><li>Reduces risk of system failures during critical documentation activities</li><li>Provides evidence of system reliability for compliance and audit purposes</li><li>Identifies performance bottlenecks before they impact productivity</li><li>Establishes baseline metrics for ongoing system monitoring</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>PQ is only needed for regulated industries - it benefits any documentation system</li><li>PQ is a one-time activity - it should be repeated after major system changes</li><li>PQ only tests technical performance - it should include user experience validation</li><li>PQ can be skipped if previous qualification phases passed - each phase serves different purposes</li></ul>",
