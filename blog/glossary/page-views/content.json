    "quick_definition": "Page Views is a web analytics metric that tracks how many times users access and load specific documentation pages. It provides essential insights into content popularity, user engagement patterns, and helps documentation teams identify their most valuable content and areas needing improvement.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Page Views represent one of the fundamental metrics for measuring documentation performance, tracking each instance when a user loads a specific page or document. This metric serves as a cornerstone for understanding user behavior and content effectiveness in documentation ecosystems.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Real-time tracking of individual page loads and document access</li><li>Historical data collection enabling trend analysis over time</li><li>Integration with analytics platforms for comprehensive reporting</li><li>Segmentation capabilities by user type, geography, and traffic source</li><li>Cross-device tracking for unified user journey insights</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Identifies high-performing content that resonates with users</li><li>Reveals gaps in content coverage through low-traffic page analysis</li><li>Supports data-driven decisions for content prioritization and resource allocation</li><li>Enables performance benchmarking and goal setting for documentation initiatives</li><li>Facilitates user experience optimization through traffic pattern analysis</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Higher page views don't always indicate better content quality or user satisfaction</li><li>Page views alone cannot measure content effectiveness without considering engagement metrics</li><li>Duplicate counting can occur when users refresh pages or navigate back and forth</li><li>Page views don't distinguish between intentional visits and accidental clicks</li></ul>",
