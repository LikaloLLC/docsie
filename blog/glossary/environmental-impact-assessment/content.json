    "quick_definition": "Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a systematic process that evaluates the potential environmental effects of proposed projects before implementation. For documentation professionals, it involves assessing how documentation practices, digital workflows, and content management systems impact environmental sustainability. This process helps organizations make informed decisions about eco-friendly documentation strategies while maintaining operational efficiency.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in documentation involves systematically evaluating how documentation practices, digital workflows, and content management decisions affect environmental sustainability. This process helps organizations balance operational needs with environmental responsibility.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Systematic evaluation of digital carbon footprint from documentation platforms and workflows</li><li>Assessment of paper usage, printing practices, and physical storage requirements</li><li>Analysis of server energy consumption for cloud-based documentation systems</li><li>Evaluation of travel reduction through effective remote documentation practices</li><li>Integration of sustainability metrics into documentation project planning</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces operational costs through optimized resource usage and energy efficiency</li><li>Enhances corporate sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental regulations</li><li>Improves stakeholder confidence by demonstrating environmental responsibility</li><li>Identifies opportunities for process optimization and waste reduction</li><li>Supports remote collaboration, reducing travel-related emissions</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Digital documentation always has zero environmental impact</li><li>EIA is only relevant for large-scale industrial projects</li><li>Environmental assessments are too complex for documentation teams to implement</li><li>Sustainability measures necessarily compromise documentation quality or accessibility</li></ul>",
