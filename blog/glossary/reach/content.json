  "term": "REACH",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is an EU regulation that governs the production and use of chemical substances in products. For documentation professionals, REACH requires comprehensive technical documentation, safety data sheets, and compliance records for any products containing regulated chemicals. This regulation significantly impacts product documentation workflows, requiring detailed chemical composition tracking and regulatory compliance documentation.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>REACH regulation fundamentally transforms how documentation teams handle product information for any items containing chemical substances. This comprehensive EU framework requires extensive documentation trails, safety assessments, and compliance records that must be maintained and updated throughout a product's lifecycle.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Mandatory registration documentation for chemical substances above 1 tonne per year</li><li>Comprehensive safety data sheets (SDS) requiring regular updates</li><li>Authorization documentation for substances of very high concern (SVHC)</li><li>Restriction compliance records and impact assessments</li><li>Supply chain communication requirements with downstream users</li><li>Chemical safety reports for high-volume substances</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Standardized documentation frameworks reduce inconsistencies across products</li><li>Clear regulatory requirements provide structured content guidelines</li><li>Enhanced traceability improves document version control and audit trails</li><li>Systematic approach to safety documentation protects both users and organizations</li><li>Streamlined compliance processes reduce manual documentation overhead</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>REACH only applies to chemical manufacturers - actually affects any product containing chemicals</li><li>Documentation is one-time requirement - actually requires ongoing updates and maintenance</li><li>Small quantities are exempt - registration thresholds are cumulative across EU market</li><li>Translation is optional - safety information must be provided in local languages</li></ul>",
