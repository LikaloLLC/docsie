    "quick_definition": "Knowledge Management (KM) is the systematic process of capturing, organizing, storing, and sharing organizational knowledge to improve decision-making and efficiency. For documentation professionals, it involves creating structured systems to collect institutional knowledge, making it easily accessible and reusable across teams.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Knowledge Management (KM) represents a strategic approach to harnessing an organization's collective intelligence through systematic documentation, storage, and sharing of information. For documentation professionals, KM serves as the foundation for creating sustainable, scalable information systems that preserve institutional knowledge and facilitate continuous learning.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Centralized knowledge repositories with searchable content</li><li>Standardized documentation processes and templates</li><li>Version control and content lifecycle management</li><li>Collaborative authoring and review workflows</li><li>Analytics and usage tracking for content optimization</li><li>Integration with existing tools and systems</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduced time spent searching for information</li><li>Improved consistency across documentation</li><li>Enhanced collaboration between team members</li><li>Better onboarding for new team members</li><li>Preserved knowledge when employees leave</li><li>Data-driven insights for content improvement</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>KM is just about technology platforms rather than processes and culture</li><li>Only large organizations need formal knowledge management systems</li><li>KM systems maintain themselves without ongoing curation</li><li>All organizational knowledge should be documented immediately</li></ul>",
