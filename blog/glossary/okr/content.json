    "quick_definition": "OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework that helps documentation teams define clear, measurable objectives and track progress through specific, quantifiable key results. It aligns documentation efforts with business goals by establishing ambitious objectives supported by 2-5 measurable outcomes that indicate success.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is a strategic goal-setting framework that enables documentation teams to align their work with broader organizational objectives while maintaining focus on measurable outcomes. Originally popularized by companies like Google and Intel, OKRs provide a structured approach to setting ambitious goals and tracking progress through specific, quantifiable metrics.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Objective:</strong> A qualitative, inspirational goal that describes what you want to achieve</li><li><strong>Key Results:</strong> 2-5 quantitative metrics that measure progress toward the objective</li><li><strong>Quarterly cycles:</strong> Typically set for 3-month periods with regular check-ins</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> OKRs are visible across the organization to promote alignment</li><li><strong>Ambitious targets:</strong> Designed to stretch teams beyond comfort zones (60-70% achievement is considered successful)</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Connects documentation work directly to business value and user outcomes</li><li>Provides clear priorities when managing multiple documentation projects</li><li>Enables data-driven decision making through measurable key results</li><li>Improves stakeholder communication by demonstrating documentation impact</li><li>Facilitates better resource allocation and team focus</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>OKRs are not performance reviews or individual evaluation tools</li><li>100% completion isn't the goal - ambitious targets expect 60-70% achievement</li><li>Key Results should measure outcomes, not activities or tasks</li><li>OKRs aren't meant to capture all work, just the most important priorities</li></ul>",
