  "term": "Self-hosted",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Self-hosted deployment refers to installing and running documentation software on an organization's own servers or infrastructure rather than using cloud-based services. This approach gives organizations complete control over their documentation platform, data storage, and security configurations. Self-hosted solutions are particularly valuable for organizations with strict compliance requirements or those needing extensive customization capabilities.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Self-hosted documentation platforms represent a deployment strategy where organizations install and manage documentation software on their own infrastructure, maintaining complete control over the system, data, and security protocols. This approach contrasts with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions where the vendor manages the infrastructure and platform maintenance.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Complete data ownership and control over storage locations</li><li>Full customization capabilities for branding, functionality, and integrations</li><li>Direct access to underlying databases and file systems</li><li>Ability to implement custom security protocols and access controls</li><li>Integration flexibility with existing enterprise systems and workflows</li><li>Scalability control based on organizational needs and budget</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enhanced security and compliance adherence for sensitive documentation</li><li>Reduced long-term costs for large-scale documentation operations</li><li>Unlimited customization potential for specialized documentation workflows</li><li>Independence from vendor service limitations or pricing changes</li><li>Ability to maintain documentation systems during internet outages</li><li>Complete backup and disaster recovery control</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Self-hosted solutions are always more cost-effective than cloud alternatives</li><li>Technical expertise requirements are minimal for setup and maintenance</li><li>Self-hosted automatically means better security without proper configuration</li><li>All documentation tools offer equivalent self-hosted capabilities</li></ul>",
