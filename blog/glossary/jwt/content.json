  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token format that securely transmits information between parties using digital signatures. It consists of three parts (header, payload, signature) and is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. JWTs are stateless, self-contained tokens that can verify user identity without requiring server-side session storage.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standardized method for securely transmitting information between parties as a compact, digitally signed token. For documentation teams, JWTs provide a robust authentication mechanism that enables secure access to documentation platforms, APIs, and content management systems.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Three-part structure: header (algorithm info), payload (claims/data), and signature (verification)</li><li>Stateless authentication - no server-side session storage required</li><li>Self-contained tokens that include all necessary user information</li><li>URL-safe encoding for easy transmission across web protocols</li><li>Configurable expiration times for enhanced security</li><li>Support for custom claims and user-defined data</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Single sign-on (SSO) integration for seamless user experience across documentation tools</li><li>Secure API access for automated documentation workflows and integrations</li><li>Role-based access control to protect sensitive documentation content</li><li>Reduced server load through stateless authentication architecture</li><li>Enhanced security through digital signatures and token expiration</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>JWTs are not encrypted by default - they're only encoded and signed</li><li>Tokens should not store sensitive data in the payload as it's readable</li><li>JWTs cannot be revoked once issued until they expire naturally</li><li>Larger tokens can impact performance compared to simple session IDs</li></ul>",
