        "title": "Establish Layer Management Standards",
        "description": "Proper layer organization is crucial for maintaining clean, editable CAD files that can be easily updated and repurposed for documentation. Well-organized layers enable selective visibility, printing, and export options that streamline documentation workflows.",
        "do": "Create standardized layer naming conventions (e.g., dimensions, annotations, construction lines) and assign specific colors and line weights to each layer type for consistency across all documentation projects.",
        "dont": "Don't put all drawing elements on a single layer or use random layer names, as this makes files difficult to edit and maintain, especially when multiple team members work on the same documentation."

        "title": "Optimize File Formats for Documentation Integration",
        "description": "Different documentation platforms and use cases require specific file formats for optimal quality and functionality. Understanding when to use vector vs. raster formats and appropriate resolution settings ensures your CAD exports work seamlessly in documentation systems.",
        "do": "Export vector formats (SVG, PDF) for scalable illustrations and diagrams, use high-resolution PNG for complex renderings, and maintain source CAD files with proper metadata for future editing needs.",
        "dont": "Don't use low-resolution raster formats for line drawings or export everything in the same format regardless of intended use, as this can result in poor print quality or unnecessarily large file sizes."

        "title": "Implement Version Control for CAD Assets",
        "description": "CAD files used in documentation require systematic version control to prevent errors, enable collaboration, and maintain audit trails. This is especially critical when multiple team members contribute to technical documentation projects.",
        "do": "Use file naming conventions with version numbers, maintain change logs for significant revisions, and establish check-in/check-out procedures when multiple people need to edit CAD files used in documentation.",
        "dont": "Don't save multiple versions with unclear names like 'final', 'final2', or 'latest', and avoid working directly on shared files without proper version control protocols in place."

        "title": "Create Reusable Component Libraries",
        "description": "Building libraries of commonly used components, symbols, and templates accelerates documentation creation while ensuring consistency across projects. This approach reduces redundant work and maintains visual standards.",
        "do": "Develop standardized libraries for frequently used components, create templates for common documentation layouts, and establish procedures for adding new components to shared libraries with proper documentation.",
        "dont": "Don't recreate common elements from scratch for each project or allow team members to create personal libraries without sharing, as this leads to inconsistency and wasted effort."

        "description": "Technical documentation often needs to be delivered in multiple formats (print, web, mobile) with different resolution and size requirements. Planning your CAD workflow to accommodate these varied outputs saves time and ensures quality across all platforms.",
        "do": "Design CAD drawings with scalability in mind, use appropriate line weights and text sizes that work across different output sizes, and test exports in target documentation formats before finalizing designs.",
        "dont": "Don't create CAD drawings optimized for only one output format or use text and line weights that become illegible when scaled down for mobile or thumbnail views in documentation systems."
