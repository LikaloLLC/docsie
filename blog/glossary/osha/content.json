    "quick_definition": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a U.S. federal agency that enforces workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers from job-related hazards. For documentation professionals, OSHA compliance requires creating, maintaining, and managing safety documentation, training materials, and regulatory reports. Understanding OSHA standards is essential for organizations to document safety procedures and maintain compliance records effectively.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Labor that sets and enforces safety standards to ensure safe and healthy working conditions. For documentation professionals, OSHA represents a critical compliance framework that requires systematic documentation of safety procedures, training records, incident reports, and regulatory communications.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Mandatory safety standards across industries with specific documentation requirements</li><li>Regular workplace inspections requiring accessible compliance documentation</li><li>Employee training documentation and certification tracking</li><li>Incident reporting and investigation documentation protocols</li><li>Hazard communication standards requiring detailed safety data sheets</li><li>Record-keeping requirements for workplace injuries and illnesses</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Standardized documentation frameworks that improve consistency</li><li>Clear regulatory guidelines that define documentation scope and requirements</li><li>Structured approach to safety communication and training materials</li><li>Audit trail capabilities that enhance accountability and compliance tracking</li><li>Integration opportunities with existing quality management systems</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>OSHA compliance is only relevant for manufacturing or high-risk industries</li><li>Documentation requirements are one-time tasks rather than ongoing processes</li><li>Generic safety templates are sufficient for OSHA compliance</li><li>Only safety managers need to understand OSHA documentation requirements</li></ul>",
