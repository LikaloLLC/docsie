    "quick_definition": "Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are standardized documents that provide comprehensive information about chemical substances, including their hazards, safe handling procedures, and emergency measures. They serve as critical reference materials for workplace safety compliance and risk management. Documentation professionals use SDS to create safety protocols, training materials, and regulatory compliance documentation.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are legally mandated documents that communicate essential safety information about chemical products and substances. These standardized forms follow a 16-section format established by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), ensuring consistent information delivery across industries and borders.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Standardized 16-section format covering identification, hazards, composition, first aid, and disposal</li><li>Regulatory compliance with OSHA, EPA, and international safety standards</li><li>Regular updates required when new safety information becomes available</li><li>Multi-language availability for global workplace safety</li><li>Digital accessibility and searchable content for quick reference</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Streamlined creation of safety manuals and training materials</li><li>Consistent formatting reduces documentation errors and revision time</li><li>Built-in compliance framework simplifies regulatory documentation</li><li>Centralized chemical information improves cross-referencing capabilities</li><li>Version control mechanisms ensure teams work with current safety data</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>SDS are only needed for obviously dangerous chemicals - all chemical products require them</li><li>Once created, SDS never need updates - they must be revised when new safety data emerges</li><li>SDS are purely regulatory documents - they're practical tools for daily operations and training</li><li>Only safety personnel need access to SDS - all workers handling chemicals should have access</li></ul>",
