  "term": "Biocompatibility",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Biocompatibility is the ability of a medical device or material to perform its intended function without causing adverse biological responses when in contact with living tissue. For documentation professionals, it represents the critical safety standard that must be thoroughly documented throughout the entire medical device lifecycle, from initial design specifications to post-market surveillance reports.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Biocompatibility serves as a fundamental safety principle in medical device development, requiring comprehensive documentation to demonstrate that materials and devices will not cause harmful reactions when used in or on the human body. Documentation teams play a crucial role in creating, maintaining, and organizing the extensive evidence required to prove biocompatibility compliance.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Risk-based evaluation approach requiring systematic documentation of biological testing protocols</li><li>Multi-stage assessment process from material characterization to clinical evaluation</li><li>Regulatory compliance requirements across different global markets (FDA, CE, ISO 10993)</li><li>Traceability requirements linking raw materials to final device performance</li><li>Post-market surveillance documentation for ongoing safety monitoring</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Provides clear regulatory framework for organizing technical documentation</li><li>Creates standardized templates and workflows for biological evaluation reports</li><li>Establishes consistent review processes across product development teams</li><li>Enables efficient document version control for complex testing protocols</li><li>Facilitates faster regulatory submissions through organized evidence packages</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Biocompatibility is not a one-time test but requires ongoing documentation throughout device lifecycle</li><li>Documentation requirements vary significantly based on device contact type and duration</li><li>Historical biocompatibility data cannot always be applied to new device configurations without additional documentation</li><li>Risk management documentation must be integrated with biocompatibility assessments</li></ul>",
