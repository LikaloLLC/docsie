  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "A Device Master Record (DMR) is the comprehensive collection of all documents, specifications, and procedures required to manufacture a medical device. It serves as the definitive reference containing design specifications, manufacturing instructions, quality requirements, and regulatory compliance documentation that ensures consistent and compliant device production.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A Device Master Record (DMR) represents the cornerstone of medical device manufacturing documentation, containing every specification, procedure, and requirement necessary to produce a compliant medical device. This comprehensive document collection serves as the single source of truth for manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and quality assurance teams.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Complete device specifications including materials, dimensions, and performance criteria</li><li>Detailed manufacturing procedures and assembly instructions</li><li>Quality control requirements and acceptance criteria</li><li>Labeling specifications and packaging requirements</li><li>Installation and servicing procedures</li><li>Risk management documentation and safety protocols</li><li>Regulatory compliance records and approval documentation</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Centralized repository eliminates document fragmentation and version confusion</li><li>Standardized format ensures consistency across different device lines</li><li>Streamlined regulatory submissions through organized documentation structure</li><li>Enhanced traceability for audit trails and change management</li><li>Improved collaboration between engineering, manufacturing, and quality teams</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>DMR is not just a single document but a comprehensive record system</li><li>It's not static documentation - requires regular updates throughout device lifecycle</li><li>DMR differs from Device History Record (DHR) which tracks actual production batches</li><li>Not all manufacturing documents belong in DMR - only those essential for device definition</li></ul>",
