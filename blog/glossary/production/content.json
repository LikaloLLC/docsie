        "solution": "Deploy a production knowledge base with real-time content management, user feedback integration, and performance analytics to identify and update problematic content.",
        "implementation": "1. Establish content audit workflows that review articles based on user engagement metrics. 2. Implement user rating systems and feedback collection on each article. 3. Set up automated alerts for articles with high bounce rates or low satisfaction scores. 4. Create rapid content update processes for critical support topics.",
        "outcome": "Knowledge base articles maintain 95% accuracy, customer self-service rates increase by 60%, and support ticket volume decreases significantly."
