    "quick_definition": "A cloud-based system is software and data storage that operates on remote servers accessed via the internet, eliminating the need for local infrastructure. For documentation teams, this means collaborative writing platforms, content management systems, and knowledge bases that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Cloud-based systems have revolutionized how documentation teams create, manage, and distribute content by moving operations from local servers to remote, internet-accessible infrastructure. This shift enables seamless collaboration, automatic updates, and global accessibility for documentation workflows.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Remote server infrastructure managed by cloud providers</li><li>Internet-based access from any device or location</li><li>Automatic software updates and maintenance</li><li>Scalable storage and computing resources</li><li>Built-in backup and disaster recovery</li><li>Multi-user collaboration capabilities</li><li>API integrations with other tools</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Real-time collaboration across distributed teams</li><li>Reduced IT overhead and maintenance costs</li><li>Automatic version control and change tracking</li><li>Instant publishing and content distribution</li><li>Mobile accessibility for on-the-go editing</li><li>Integrated analytics and usage tracking</li><li>Enhanced security with enterprise-grade protection</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Cloud systems are less secure than on-premise solutions</li><li>Internet dependency makes cloud systems unreliable</li><li>Migration to cloud is always complex and expensive</li><li>Organizations lose control over their data</li><li>Cloud solutions are only suitable for large enterprises</li></ul>",
