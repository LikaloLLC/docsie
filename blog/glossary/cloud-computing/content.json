    "quick_definition": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services\u2014including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics\u2014over the internet ('the cloud') rather than using local hardware. For documentation professionals, this means accessing documentation tools, storage, and collaboration platforms through web browsers without installing or maintaining local software. This approach enables real-time collaboration, automatic updates, and scalable storage for documentation projects.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Cloud computing revolutionizes how documentation teams create, store, and manage content by providing on-demand access to computing resources over the internet. Instead of relying on local servers and software installations, teams can leverage powerful cloud-based tools and infrastructure that scale with their needs.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>On-demand self-service access to computing resources</li><li>Broad network access from any device with internet connectivity</li><li>Resource pooling that serves multiple users efficiently</li><li>Rapid elasticity to scale resources up or down as needed</li><li>Measured service with pay-as-you-use pricing models</li><li>Automatic software updates and maintenance</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Real-time collaboration across distributed teams</li><li>Reduced IT infrastructure costs and maintenance overhead</li><li>Automatic backups and disaster recovery capabilities</li><li>Seamless integration between documentation tools and platforms</li><li>Enhanced accessibility from multiple devices and locations</li><li>Improved version control and content synchronization</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Cloud computing is less secure than on-premise solutions</li><li>Organizations lose complete control over their data</li><li>Cloud services are always more expensive than local alternatives</li><li>Internet connectivity issues make cloud computing unreliable</li><li>Migration to cloud platforms is too complex for small teams</li></ul>",
