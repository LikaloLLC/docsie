    "quick_definition": "A prototype is an early working model or sample of a product, feature, or documentation system used to test concepts, functionality, and user experience before full-scale development. In documentation, prototypes help teams validate information architecture, content structure, and user workflows through tangible, testable versions of their documentation systems.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>A prototype serves as a preliminary version of a documentation system, allowing teams to explore ideas, test functionality, and gather feedback before committing to full development. This approach reduces risk and ensures the final product meets user needs effectively.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Interactive elements that simulate final functionality</li><li>Core content structure and navigation patterns</li><li>Basic visual design and layout concepts</li><li>User flow demonstrations and key user journeys</li><li>Testable components for feedback collection</li><li>Iterative refinement capabilities</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Validates information architecture before full content creation</li><li>Identifies usability issues early in the development process</li><li>Facilitates stakeholder alignment and buy-in</li><li>Reduces development costs by catching problems early</li><li>Enables user testing with minimal resource investment</li><li>Accelerates decision-making through tangible examples</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Prototypes must be high-fidelity and polished</li><li>Prototyping delays the overall project timeline</li><li>Only technical teams can create effective prototypes</li><li>Prototypes should include all final features and content</li><li>Paper sketches and wireframes don't qualify as prototypes</li></ul>",
