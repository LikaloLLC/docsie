  "term": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability where malicious websites trick authenticated users into unknowingly performing unwanted actions on trusted web applications. For documentation teams, this means protecting content management systems, wikis, and collaboration platforms from unauthorized changes or data breaches when users are logged in.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) represents a critical security concern for documentation teams managing web-based platforms and content management systems. This vulnerability exploits the trust relationship between a user and a website, potentially allowing malicious actors to perform unauthorized actions on documentation platforms where users maintain active sessions.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Exploits authenticated user sessions without their knowledge or consent</li><li>Operates through malicious links, emails, or embedded content on third-party sites</li><li>Can trigger unauthorized actions like content deletion, user permission changes, or data modification</li><li>Bypasses same-origin policy restrictions by leveraging existing user authentication</li><li>Often invisible to end users, making detection challenging without proper monitoring</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Understanding CSRF helps protect valuable documentation assets from unauthorized modifications</li><li>Enables implementation of proper security measures in documentation workflows</li><li>Reduces risk of content tampering or accidental data loss through malicious exploitation</li><li>Supports compliance with security standards and organizational policies</li><li>Builds user trust by maintaining platform integrity and reliability</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>CSRF attacks require direct access to user credentials (they don't - they exploit existing sessions)</li><li>Only financial or e-commerce sites are vulnerable (documentation platforms are equally at risk)</li><li>Strong passwords alone prevent CSRF attacks (session-based exploitation bypasses password protection)</li><li>CSRF and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are the same vulnerability (they're distinct attack vectors)</li></ul>",
