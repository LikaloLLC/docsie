  "term": "Custom Deployment",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Custom deployment is the process of installing and configuring documentation software on your organization's own servers or infrastructure, providing complete control over the hosting environment. This approach contrasts with cloud-hosted solutions by allowing documentation teams to maintain data sovereignty, implement custom security protocols, and integrate deeply with existing enterprise systems.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Custom deployment refers to the practice of installing documentation software directly on an organization's own servers or infrastructure, rather than relying on vendor-hosted cloud solutions. This deployment model gives documentation teams complete control over their hosting environment, data storage, and system configurations.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Full server and infrastructure control</li><li>Custom security implementations and compliance adherence</li><li>Direct database access and backup management</li><li>Integration with existing enterprise authentication systems</li><li>Customizable server configurations and performance optimization</li><li>Network isolation and air-gapped deployment capabilities</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Enhanced data privacy and regulatory compliance</li><li>Seamless integration with internal tools and workflows</li><li>Reduced long-term costs for large-scale deployments</li><li>Faster performance through optimized infrastructure</li><li>Complete customization of user experience and branding</li><li>Independence from vendor service availability</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Custom deployment is only for large enterprises (small teams can benefit too)</li><li>It requires extensive technical expertise (many solutions offer simplified installation)</li><li>It's always more expensive than cloud solutions (can be cost-effective at scale)</li><li>Updates and maintenance are overly complex (modern tools provide automated update mechanisms)</li></ul>",
