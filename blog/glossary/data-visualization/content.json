    "quick_definition": "Data visualization is the graphical representation of information using charts, graphs, and interactive displays to transform complex data into easily digestible visual formats. For documentation professionals, it serves as a powerful tool to present analytics, user feedback, and process flows in ways that enhance comprehension and decision-making.",
