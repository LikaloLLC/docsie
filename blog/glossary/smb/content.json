    "quick_definition": "Small and Medium-sized Business (SMB) refers to companies that fall between small office/home office setups and large enterprises, typically characterized by limited resources, smaller teams, and streamlined operations. These organizations require documentation solutions that are cost-effective, easy to implement, and scalable as they grow.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) represent a crucial segment of the economy, encompassing companies that have outgrown startup status but haven't reached enterprise scale. For documentation professionals, understanding SMB needs is essential as these organizations require tailored approaches that balance functionality with resource constraints.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Limited IT resources and smaller technical teams</li><li>Budget constraints requiring cost-effective solutions</li><li>Need for quick implementation and minimal training</li><li>Emphasis on practical, user-friendly tools</li><li>Growth-oriented mindset requiring scalable solutions</li><li>Cross-functional teams wearing multiple hats</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Faster decision-making processes due to flatter organizational structures</li><li>Direct access to stakeholders and end-users for feedback</li><li>Opportunity to implement documentation standards from the ground up</li><li>Flexibility to experiment with new tools and methodologies</li><li>Ability to demonstrate clear ROI on documentation investments</li><li>Close collaboration between technical writers and subject matter experts</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>SMBs don't need sophisticated documentation tools</li><li>Simple solutions always mean less effective outcomes</li><li>SMBs can't afford professional documentation practices</li><li>One-size-fits-all approaches work for all SMBs</li><li>SMB documentation needs are just scaled-down enterprise requirements</li></ul>",
