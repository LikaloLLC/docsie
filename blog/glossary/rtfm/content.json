    "quick_definition": "RTFM (Read The F***ing Manual) is a tech community acronym encouraging users to consult existing documentation before seeking help. While often perceived as dismissive, it highlights the importance of comprehensive, accessible documentation that empowers users to find answers independently.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>RTFM stands for \"Read The F***ing Manual\" - a blunt acronym that has become deeply embedded in tech culture. While the phrase can sound harsh, it represents a fundamental principle: quality documentation should be the first line of support, empowering users to solve problems independently.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Emphasizes documentation as primary support resource</li><li>Encourages user self-sufficiency and problem-solving</li><li>Reduces repetitive support requests for documented issues</li><li>Promotes thorough exploration of available resources</li><li>Creates accountability for both writers and readers</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Validates the importance of comprehensive documentation</li><li>Reduces support ticket volume for documented procedures</li><li>Identifies gaps where users consistently need additional help</li><li>Encourages investment in searchable, well-organized content</li><li>Builds user confidence through self-service capabilities</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>That RTFM is inherently hostile - it can promote documentation quality</li><li>That all user questions indicate documentation failure</li><li>That complex topics don't need detailed documentation</li><li>That RTFM absolves teams from improving unclear content</li></ul>",
