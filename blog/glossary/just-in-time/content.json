    "quick_definition": "Just-in-Time (JIT) in documentation is a strategy that creates, updates, and delivers information precisely when needed rather than maintaining extensive documentation libraries. This approach reduces waste by focusing resources on actively used content and eliminates outdated or unnecessary documentation.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Just-in-Time (JIT) documentation is a lean approach that prioritizes creating and maintaining content based on immediate user needs and actual demand. Rather than producing comprehensive documentation upfront, teams focus on delivering the right information at the right moment.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Demand-driven content creation based on user requests and analytics</li><li>Minimal viable documentation that covers essential use cases</li><li>Rapid response system for addressing documentation gaps</li><li>Continuous refinement based on user feedback and usage patterns</li><li>Integration with user workflows and support channels</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduced maintenance overhead for unused or outdated content</li><li>Higher content relevance and user satisfaction</li><li>More efficient resource allocation and team productivity</li><li>Faster response to changing product features and user needs</li><li>Improved content quality through focused attention on high-impact areas</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>JIT means having no documentation prepared in advance</li><li>It's only suitable for small teams or simple products</li><li>Quality suffers due to rushed content creation</li><li>It eliminates the need for content planning and strategy</li></ul>",

        "title": "API Documentation for New Features",
        "problem": "Development teams release features faster than documentation teams can create comprehensive guides, leading to gaps in API documentation.",
        "solution": "Implement JIT documentation that creates essential API docs when developers request them or when support tickets indicate user confusion.",
        "implementation": "1. Set up automated alerts for new API endpoints\n2. Create templates for rapid API documentation\n3. Establish a 24-hour response time for critical API docs\n4. Use user feedback to prioritize which endpoints need detailed examples\n5. Expand documentation based on actual usage patterns",
        "outcome": "Reduced time-to-documentation from weeks to hours, improved developer satisfaction, and elimination of unused documentation overhead."

        "title": "Customer Support Knowledge Base",
        "problem": "Support teams spend time maintaining extensive knowledge bases where 80% of articles are rarely accessed, while frequently asked questions lack proper documentation.",
        "solution": "Create documentation based on actual support ticket volume and customer inquiries, focusing on high-impact, frequently requested information.",
        "implementation": "1. Analyze support ticket data to identify top issues\n2. Create documentation only for problems that occur more than 5 times per month\n3. Set up automatic alerts when new issue patterns emerge\n4. Empower support agents to create quick documentation during ticket resolution\n5. Review and archive low-usage content quarterly",
        "outcome": "90% reduction in maintenance overhead, faster resolution times, and higher customer satisfaction scores."

        "title": "Internal Process Documentation",

        "solution": "Document processes only when team members request clarification or when onboarding new employees, keeping content minimal and current.",
        "implementation": "1. Replace comprehensive process manuals with FAQ-style documentation\n2. Create documentation during actual process execution\n3. Use screen recordings and quick guides instead of lengthy written procedures\n4. Update documentation immediately when processes change\n5. Archive documentation for discontinued processes",
        "outcome": "Always-current process documentation, reduced onboarding time, and elimination of conflicting or outdated procedures."

        "solution": "Create feature documentation based on user adoption metrics and support requests, focusing on features that users actually discover and use.",
        "implementation": "1. Integrate analytics to track feature usage\n2. Create basic documentation for all features, detailed docs only for popular ones\n3. Set usage thresholds that trigger expanded documentation\n4. Use in-app contextual help instead of external comprehensive guides\n5. Regularly review and update based on feature adoption data",
