  "term": "Active Voice",
  "content": {
    "quick_definition": "Active voice is a writing style where the subject of a sentence performs the action, creating clear and direct statements. In documentation, active voice makes instructions more engaging and easier to follow by clearly identifying who does what. This approach reduces ambiguity and improves user comprehension compared to passive voice constructions.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>Active voice is a fundamental writing principle that places the subject as the performer of the action in a sentence. For documentation professionals, mastering active voice is essential for creating clear, actionable content that guides users effectively through processes and procedures.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Subject performs the action directly (e.g., \"Click the button\" vs. \"The button should be clicked\")</li><li>Follows a clear Subject-Verb-Object structure</li><li>Uses fewer words than passive constructions</li><li>Creates immediate, actionable statements</li><li>Eliminates ambiguity about who performs each action</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Reduces cognitive load on readers by providing clear instructions</li><li>Improves translation accuracy for global documentation</li><li>Enhances SEO performance through direct, keyword-rich content</li><li>Increases user task completion rates</li><li>Creates consistent voice across documentation sets</li><li>Reduces support tickets by eliminating confusion</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>Active voice is always shorter (sometimes passive voice is appropriate for emphasis)</li><li>All passive voice should be eliminated (some contexts benefit from passive construction)</li><li>Active voice sounds too informal for technical documentation</li><li>Converting to active voice always improves readability without considering context</li></ul>",

        "title": "API Documentation Instructions",
        "problem": "Passive voice in API documentation creates confusion about who performs authentication steps, leading to implementation errors and increased support requests.",
        "solution": "Convert all procedural steps to active voice, clearly specifying whether the developer, system, or API performs each action.",
        "implementation": "1. Audit existing API docs for passive constructions 2. Identify the actor for each step (developer, server, API) 3. Rewrite using active voice with clear subjects 4. Test revised instructions with developers 5. Monitor support ticket reduction",
        "outcome": "Developers complete API integration 40% faster with fewer authentication errors and reduced support escalations."

        "solution": "Restructure all user procedures using active voice to clearly distinguish user actions from system responses.",
        "implementation": "1. Map each procedure step to either user or system action 2. Rewrite user steps with 'you' as subject 3. Rewrite system steps with specific system components as subjects 4. Use consistent verb tenses throughout 5. Validate with user testing sessions",
        "outcome": "User task completion rates increase by 35% with significantly reduced confusion about manual versus automatic steps."

        "implementation": "1. Convert diagnostic questions to active voice prompts 2. Specify who performs each troubleshooting step 3. Use imperative mood for user actions 4. Clearly state expected system responses 5. Test guides with support team and users",
        "outcome": "Support resolution time decreases by 25% as users can independently follow clearer diagnostic procedures."

        "solution": "Rewrite installation steps using active voice to explicitly indicate when users must act versus when systems automatically respond.",
        "implementation": "1. Separate manual user steps from automatic system processes 2. Use active voice imperatives for user actions ('Download the file') 3. Use active voice descriptions for system actions ('The installer creates a directory') 4. Add clear indicators for wait times and automatic processes 5. Validate with fresh installation testing",
        "outcome": "Installation success rate improves by 50% with users reporting greater confidence in following the step-by-step process."
