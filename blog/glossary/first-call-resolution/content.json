    "quick_definition": "First-Call Resolution (FCR) is a customer service metric that measures the percentage of support issues resolved during the initial contact without requiring follow-up interactions. For documentation teams, it indicates how effectively their content enables support agents to solve user problems on the first attempt. Higher FCR rates typically correlate with better documentation quality and user satisfaction.",
    "detailed_explanation": "<p>First-Call Resolution (FCR) represents a critical performance indicator that measures how often customer issues are completely resolved during the initial support interaction. For documentation professionals, FCR serves as a direct reflection of content effectiveness and accessibility.</p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li>Measures resolution success rate on initial contact</li><li>Tracks documentation effectiveness in real-world scenarios</li><li>Identifies content gaps and knowledge base weaknesses</li><li>Provides quantifiable feedback on user experience quality</li><li>Correlates directly with customer satisfaction scores</li></ul><h3>Benefits for Documentation Teams</h3><ul><li>Validates content strategy and information architecture decisions</li><li>Reduces support ticket volume and operational costs</li><li>Improves user satisfaction and product adoption rates</li><li>Provides data-driven insights for content optimization</li><li>Enhances collaboration between documentation and support teams</li></ul><h3>Common Misconceptions</h3><ul><li>FCR only applies to phone support, not self-service documentation</li><li>Higher FCR always means better documentation quality</li><li>FCR improvements require complete content overhauls</li><li>Technical accuracy is more important than findability for FCR</li></ul>",
