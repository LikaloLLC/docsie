5/4/2021 15:06:11,Tal Frenkel,"Are you running a business in 2022? What’s your most precious asset? Information is one of the most useful assets in running a business. Company owners and shareholders rely on data to make prudent business decisions. 



The marketing department relies on information to evaluate the potential of product success. Marketers also use the same information to reach out to their intended targets. Most importantly, you need all your business information in one place to make trading and transaction documents.

In that case, you’d want an innovative documentation platform that guarantees information safety and multiple access for employee collaboration. You can leverage a [reliable ](https://www.docsie.io/)[system like ](https://www.docsie.io/)[Do](https://www.docsie.io/)[csie](https://www.docsie.io/) to manage your internal software documentation. 

Read on as we explore the 5 key benefits of using a documentation platform for maintaining software documentation in your business.

1. **Enhanced Security**

As an online business, your primary concern should be the [security of your information](https://medium.com/the-mission/data-security-how-to-keep-your-customers-information-safe-a3150510a7b7) and customer data. Security is a big challenge that many organizations have to deal with, especially during the pandemic when cyber insecurity is on the rise. It can even be worse if you rely on manual documentation as it is easily accessible to anyone. Sensitive information may land into the hands of the wrong person, who may end up leaking it to competitors.

Getting a strong documentation platform for maintaining your software documents guarantees water-tight security. Software documentation platforms have a digital trail, and you can easily track unauthorized access. Whether the access is from within or without, you can retrieve the editor’s information, including the time of access. Thus, you can quickly tell if there is an external attack or just a dishonest employee. 

Most importantly, you can regulate persons that can access certain document based on position and clearance. That makes it easy to manage employees in their respective departments.

1. **Improved, Automated Workflow**

Every business drafts and compiles various documents on a routine basis. By the end of the month, when it’s time to reconcile the period’s work, every department would need copies of the documents. It can be quite challenging to recreate copies without wasting time and resources. 

Moreover, humans get tired of doing repetitive tasks for long periods. Besides running out of time, you’ll likely end up with disorganized files.

A reliable software documentation platform ensures flawless communication lines to both internal and external departments. You can easily classify documents as you generate them. Hence, you enhance speedier and streamlined business processes to [save on costs of operation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/03/25/15-smart-ways-you-can-save-money-as-a-new-business/). This can also keep you from losing revenue due to insufficient data.

1. **Enhanced Backup and Recovery**

The last thing that you want for your business is to lose data. It will be like a new startup because you’ll need to build a new customer database. You may also lose your fortunes if vital information like bank details land in the hands of the bad guys. 

Not to forget, you’ll not experience a favorable competitive environment if you lose all the data that built your business from scratch. It will hardly ever be the same again, especially if the company is a decade-plus old.

Innovative software documentation platform enhances your backup and recovery process. If you lose all data, say because of an internal technical hitch, you’ll retrieve the same in less than an hour. The platform also helps if your primary backup system gets compromised. You can easily restore data without parting with any ransom.

1. **Easier Retrieval**

The average online consumer will expect your brand to solve their issue in about three hours during working days. Otherwise, you’ll get complaints all over the brand’s social media messages. The last thing that you want is losing regular customers and scaring away prospective clients. Moreover, you’d also like to cut down customer care costs as much as possible for better profit margins.

Acquiring an [advanced ](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8026-choosing-a-document-management-system.html)[software documentation platform](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8026-choosing-a-document-management-system.html) means you can easily retrieve files in seconds. You can leverage retrieval tips like searching by word, phrase, or the customer’s credentials.  For larger business files, you can arrange them by index hence easier number reference.

1. **Version Control**

Businesses handle various types of documents, including confidential and public. Some documents require a specific department's input only, but still, other workers may need access. 

For instance, some finance documents like quarterly and annual reports should only have the accounts department’s input. Even so, employees and shareholders also need to access it to see the company’s growth and whether their commitment is paying off.

Modern software documentation platforms allow you to share files in different versions. For instance, a “read only” version would suffice for sensitive accounting documents. You can also automate the process of sharing such customized documents.

**Bottom Line**

Automating document management using advanced software is inevitable for your business’ success. Apart from lowering operations costs, it guarantees the business' perpetual existence. You’ll enjoy reliable data backup and retrieval processes.

Throughout the customer journey, people search for information and guidance to support their purchasing decisions. Before a purchase, customers want to understand how a product works and whether it will meet their requirements. During and after a purchase, customers will appreciate documentation detailing how to configure and use your service – helping them shape and mold functionality to meet their needs.

To quote Matshona Dhliwayo – ""Knowledge is wealth."" Modern digital consumers are privileged to have a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips, courtesy of the internet. For enterprises that lack the capacity or ability to share knowledge on their services – this means they are losing out on a distinct, information-driven competitive advantage.

This is confirmed by a recent 2020 [Eptica](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020)[ study](https://www.eptica.com/dcx2020), where 36% of business respondents are failing to answer routine customer queries via digital channels. In a best-case scenario, these failures will drive up demand in the customer service department as people request information – increasing staff costs and workloads. The worst-case scenario is customer abandonment. Customers will find a competitor offering more pre- and post-sale documentation, thus improving confidence and the likelihood of following through on a purchase.



### Answering Routine Queries With a Self-Service Documentation Portal

### 

Routine queries are common, low-level questions concerning aspects of your product or service – including configuration, billing, and technical support. In most cases, query types will remain consistent, with similar questions being answered with equally similar responses from customer service agents. These low-level workloads are repeatable and predictable, making them ideal candidates for self-service.

By implementing a self-service documentation portal, businesses can reduce their customer support workloads. This coincides with shifting consumer sentiment. A 2020 [ContactBabel](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020)[ study](http://connect.creativevirtual.com/contactbabel-report-us-mar2020) found that 61% of US respondents identified AI-enabled self-service as 'very important.' This demonstrates how customers not only accept contact-free support, they embrace it. In particular, millennials want to serve themselves – with 73% of consumers in this [Aspect study](https://www.aspect.com/company/news/press-releases/customer-serve-thy-self-new-study-reveals-millennials-desire-for-self-service-digital-interaction-to-change-customer-service-forever) saying they should have the ability to solve problems independently.



### Using Docsie for WordPress Documentation

### 

To help consumers help themselves, implementing a documentation portal is essential. Docsie is a great way to manage and share documentation across the entire business – catering to both your loyal customers, and passionate internal employees!



### Docsie Workspaces, Books, and Shelves

Within a Docsie workspace, businesses can craft and store documentation to be published in a documentation portal. For individual products, Docsie provides a 'shelf' on which related documentation – or 'books' – can be organized and managed. Business users can create as many 'books' and 'shelves' as they require, making Docsie organizable and highly-scalable. This documentation will collectively form a 'library' where staff can add knowledge and customers can use this knowledge to learn about your products and services.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/cdhlmjjaoteiufwqsqba)



### Docsie Document Versioning

Docsie also enables document versioning, keeping multiple iterations of a document organized and available long-term. This is ideal for development teams. New product releases and API updates can be documented, with historical documentation as a backup for customers that continue using older versions of your products and services – efficiently catering to a fragmented user base.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pczuxadvbygftlmwekbo)



### Docsie Custom Documentation Hubs

Each brand looks and feels different. Docsie enables custom branding across all documentation, integrating company logos, color schemes, and typography for consistent publishing on company websites. This allows businesses to change branding assets once in Docsie and propagate these changes across all documents on any hosting platform – streamlining branding management.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/mshntomlogkgyplixkup)



### Docsie Machine Learning Language Translation

Global enterprises need to communicate knowledge in multiple languages. Docsie provides further management of translated documentation, creating alternative 'books' on each product 'shelf' for different languages. These 'books' can be manually transcribed, or businesses can opt for Docsie's built-in machine translation feature.

Machine translation will automatically translate documents into various languages – an important feature considering 75% of respondents were more likely to make a purchase if support was provided in their local language, according to a 2020 CSA research [study](https://csa-research.com/More/Media/Press-Releases/ArticleID/655/Survey-of-8-709-Consumers-in-29-Countries-Finds-that-76-Prefer-Purchasing-Products-with-Information-in-their-Own-Language).

### Docsie Vocally: Visualized Feedback

Docsie Vocally allows users to provide feedback on individual 'books' in a documentation portal. This helps businesses identify useful and impactful documentation that offers measurable benefits to users. It also helps businesses find non-performant documentation, which should be revised and replaced to offer more value to customers. Feedback consists of 'emotional ratings' on a 5-point rating scale or text messages containing explanations for feedback. Businesses can dive deeper into user experience (UX) monitoring with recorded actions on pages for each user, illustrating customer browsing habits in relation to their feedback to guide business decisions.

### Getting Started With Docsie on WordPress 5

### 

Businesses can use Docsie's functionality to manage their documentation while hosting items on a platform of their choice – in this case, WordPress. Publishing to WordPress from within Docsie could not be simpler, requiring a single deployment script to push and publish content.



### Docsie WordPress Deployment Script Creation

Open the Book you wish to publish in Docsie.

In the Settings panel, locate Properties.



![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/pmfgayfjbxpyaezonadq)

Click (get self-publish script)

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/gapavaasxhjgmzvosbtt)

Your code will appear ready to copy into WordPress.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eeugiunjmalaxajwytjx)

Additionally, in the Portal view, businesses can select existing documentation from each shelf or an entire workspace to publish.

Included here are Content Filters - Support, Site Content, Terms and Policy, Documentation, Other Pages – offering granular control over what gets published to WordPress.

Businesses can also choose Display Styles – including Version Picker, Language Picker, Section Anchors, Footer Navigation – controlling the final formatting output on WordPress.

Business users simply choose what to publish, defining content filters and display styles through the graphical user interface (GUI) – with Docsie generating a final deployment script in the lower Text Area. This is known as low-code or codeless.

Now we can publish to WordPress!



### Adding the Script to WordPress



After logging into the WordPress dashboard, navigate to Pages.

Select Add new page and create a title, or select an existing page.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/lbwsgahnmezbvkzftagh)

In the WordPress text editor, click the Add button on a website block. Select the Custom HTML option to add Docsie’s code script.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/ejdtdgrlzsahtursowbf)

Copy your deployment script in Docsie to add it to the clipboard. Then in WordPress, paste the code string into your Custom HTML box. You can also specify a WordPress page name, though Docsie will control titling for you automatically in the embedded document.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/zrmyjvznfrgterpdolmk)

The final step is clicking Preview next to HTML at the top of the page in the WordPress editor.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/eiliooqudyhoghurdeqp)

Your Docsie documentation will appear seamlessly on the page! You can now click Update in the top right to publish to your live webpage. This quick and easy process can be repeated with all of your documentation. It supports rapid publishing for small and large documentation libraries; simply paste and go!

NOTE – WordPress 5 will show its own title and other website elements using this method, perfect for embedding Docsie documents around other website elements. If you want to load nothing but the Docsie document - paste your code string into the HTML footer of your page in the WordPress Code Editor, and leave the rest of the page blank.



### Collaborate With Team Members in Docsie

### 

Docsie simplifies cross-channel publishing by improving consistency, ease of use, and scalability for large documentation libraries. Docsie also supports collaboration to help your team orchestrate their documentation management workflows.



### Docsie Internal and External Collaborators

Documentation needs to be written before it can be published. This could include internal writing staff or external collaborators paid per project to write documentation. Docsie caters to all of the above, allowing businesses to create Teams and manage people and content simultaneously.

Internal staff can be added to a Team manually by an Owner or Admin, through group policy using Docsie role-based access controls (RBAC), or request access to join a Team group.

External collaborators can be invited to a Team via email within the Docsie portal, making onboarding for contractors fast and efficient.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/axkzsfrdmsdknhqnccqj)



### Docsie Team Chat

Instead of email or Slack, businesses can use Docsie Team Chat. This centralizes communications related to your documentation to improve focus, while facilitating instant messaging (IM) for faster team responses. Team members will receive message notifications in the Docsie portal or via email – ensuring nobody misses any crucial pieces of information.

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/sqjnonxdlqfjcmhuwwhe)



### Docsie Permissions and User Management

Docsie uses a role-based access control (RBAC) framework – sometimes referred to as identity access management (IAM) -  to control user permissions for documentation access. Each user can be designated as an Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer to enable granular control over access, data governance, and security – contained under the umbrella of governance risk compliance (GRC).

1/7/2023 22:27:03,Tal F.,"At Docsie, we bring the power of versatile documentation tools to you. Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way – so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.

### Organization And Visual Dashboard Designs

![Organization And Visual Dashboard Designs](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_KcRBWUiCJ0UoEUOKC/f86c49a8-1b13-5d38-2fbe-f671f02cfaecmaxim_ilyahov_blf4r69ltgw_unsplash.jpg)

The Docsie platform works on the principle of pushing product documentation and content to its end user environments in a centralized and organized way. So much of today's software development world is built around this kind of visual dashboard approach, where it's the format and the intuitive interface that matter most.

With a great cloud hosted interface, it's easy to unify your product documentation, tackle the learning curve, and publish your content to the web – seamlessly and effortlessly. That cloud model is very useful – that’s why cloud services took over twenty-first century business so fully and quickly. But it has to be set up right!

### Virtual Books and Virtual Shelves

Here's another component of that virtual organization that drives [Docsie’s](https://www.docsie.io/) product documentation processes.

Within our interface, you'll see [virtual shelves holding discrete numbers of virtual books](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/using-docsie-library/moving-and-copying-documents/) that contain your content and documentation, and the tools to move items with key automations.

This [object-driven mentality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300921) is part of how we help our clients to onboard staff quickly and efficiently, with the system that everyone can learn to use confidently. You could think of it as the “Github for documentation” – in many ways, it’s that same process of building a context for information that is popular, easy to understand, and then universally adopted.

### Collaborative Tools


![Collaborative Tools](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_9A6GNIUeIDG1bUZID/bf6dc944-2db5-e845-f946-37c7e99ee813marvin_meyer_syto3xs06fu_unsplash.jpg)

In any content process, there are usually multiple stakeholders – people and parties working together to get the right information to the right destination.

That's also a huge part of how Docsie works, and how we have thoughtfully designed the platform to deliver. Through the documentation workflow processes in our model, it becomes easier to see what each participant is doing within a collaborative pipeline.

Publishing Automations Make Content Portable

Essentially, the[ JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) automations that we built Docsie on are an example of how API documentation tools and related resources work to allow clients to publish anywhere, instead of being confined to one isolated Wordpress silo or other shuttered destination. That versatility is at the core of how a unified documentation and content system releases its goods to the world – how you move things from drafts or beta into the full production phase.

Want to learn more about Docsie? Try one of our demos, or reach out to a friendly technician to get more information on what this type of platform can do for your business. You’ll see that principle of transparency and frictionless documentation workflows at work, helping adopters to drive efficiencies and outpace the competition.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_lqOAjT8rVqHqh8oj8/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/4291e8d4-6bd3-9c95-761d-7a53b35c66711_(1).png)



## Reasons and Benefits to create a user guide

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_iZzj1WY3nNoP7oCen/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/61ddfa77-6229-1511-c6b1-c77b1d40b8069.png)

There are many reasons to create user guides. User guides are extremely useful and play a crucial role in the world of consumers, electronics, software programs and all facets of tangible or intangible products. User guides provide your users with simple, step by step instructions on how to use and/or assemble the products.

Your customers need to be educated on the products that you are selling, services you are providing or methods and procedures that they must follow. They offer a step-by-step process in which your customers can learn how to use, and educate themselves on your product's different features and functions.

### Creating proper user guides limits the legal liability of products:

User guides also limit liabilities of incorrect use of your products. A user guide is very handy for products that may cause potential injuries or even death as a result of not properly using or assembling the product. For example: high-voltage devices, fire generating devises and even lasers require extensive manuals to protect the customer from improper use.

### Creating good user guides save time:

Good quality user manuals share instructions on how-to-use your products which can save a lot of time to your technical team explaining things or sales teams doing demos. A lot of complicated software products require good technical user guides to help their customers learn how to use their products with the highest potential. Software’s are normally bombarded by many features and having the right amount of user guides to fuel the customer with useful information’s can help in the long run to retain customers and save time on explaining how various aspects of the software and complicated products are to be used.

### Educating your customers on your products uses:

Educating customers on technical products is very important. Without proper user guides your customers can be confused by a barrage of hidden features and not know how to use the full potential of the technical product. User guides allow for an easy process in which your customers can learn to engage in the various technical aspects of your product and feel comfortable for having a user guide handy when they need to delve deeper into your products. It will take the stress away from them trying to figure things out without formal written guidance. Also for dangerous-to-use products, user guides can provide warnings against misusing products in a dangerous manner.



## What makes a great user guide

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_jripxf4mYymO4f3xy/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/fe45270c-c55d-dab5-f45c-363cc455ecb821.png)



So to start making a user guide you need to understand what problem you are trying to help solve for a specific customer. Making a user guide for everything about everything turns it into an incomprehensible mess that no one will understand including it's target audience. If you look at some of the best examples of user guides online, written by superstar companies like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments?payments=popular) or [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/categories/200111606-Using-Slack). You will notice a particular pattern. 



> Each user guide focuses on solving a particular problem. 



So what should each guide do? It should focus on simple actions that your user can accomplish while following this guide. There is no need from complication. On the contrary, if you focus on addressing common simple action that helps your users solve common simple problems with your product, you will arrive at having a set of amazing user guides that your customers will love.



So let's look closely into a few users guides to understand what is a structure of an amazing user guide so we can take that as a reference point on how we can write an amazing user guide ourselves.

## Organizing your user guides



**Using Docsie to create user guides**

Docsie has various tools and features that allows you to make awesome user guides. Firstly, lets take a look at how Docsie works. Docsie works under the premise of books and shelves and collections.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_8ASkXMSmGFUkhL3h8/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/e263c093-0b3e-b83b-bd9a-38f6cc305cb21.png)

The collections are used to isolate various books you want to show different type of customers. For example this collection is used to show Business Users only. This means that we selected only 3 books from the all of the books created to show these specific customers.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_4hX2usZ2Cfu8kxDGT/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/b69ec337-f114-7421-8222-ba3bf6c336e12.png)

This is useful when you have various different types of customers with who are using different tears of your products. This is done seamlessly on Docsie by clicking the three dots next to “All” and pressing add.

Once you are on Docsies Collection tool bar you can create the name of your collection and also pick what user guides you want in this specific collection. The reason why this is important is because different customers may need to know different user guides of your products and this tool allows you to only show the specific user guides they need to see.

The editor on top, the ability to create various version and languages on the top left corner and of course “Articles and subheading sections to the left.

The editor is simple to use, it allows you to add videos, pictures and code with our simple to use drag and drop process.  Also it allows you to stylize your contect as you see fit.

Articles are really easy to create; just type in your title. In this case the type is “What is Docsie” but you can type in whatever you desire for the title of your User Guide.

To create subsections in your user guides which will appear as 1.1,1.2..ext all you need to do is select the location of your text and set the text as ‘Header” this is done by clicking the H in the editor tab.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OCwuils7ezubiAv8a/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/1dd88460-f856-79c7-96a9-e43c31fd5f217.png)

Docsie also allows you to create various version and languages of your user guides. This is very useful and handy for localization and to talk about various alterations of your product user guides.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_vJFG764JBiJeDM4fU/boo_occBcYZBFuyefSBLr/a160f3ac-da2e-37bc-7133-a0172707c2828.png)

Once you have prepared your user guides, wrote them out, stylized them with photos which helped explain the various aspects of your products and features the next step is publishing.





## To summarize, here are the Tips and Tricks for Creating a User Guide

Most software and technical products are very complex and multi-faceted. To address this issue in creating a user guide for complex products it is a good idea to break the information and instruction down into smaller parts. Essentially creating various small user guides and compiling them into a user guide manual set-up



Your customers are not familiar with your product and or service. The more technical your product the more descriptive your user guides should be in the creation stage. Vague words and phraseology will not be your friend in this process. Be as specific as possible so that your customer can comprehend even the more remedial aspects of your product.



A picture is worth more than one thousand words. This is true, especially or user guides and manuals. This step is highly neglected by most companies, but having the right photos or snapshots of your product features and aspects of your product while explaining them on your user guides is very important. That way your customer can understand what aspects of your product you are referring to.

Your user guides are designed to help your customers understand the various uses of your products. Explain things in as simple a manner as possible so that they can understand their various features and aspects easily.

5/4/2021 16:08:10,Tal F,"**From Paper to Pixels**

Only a few decades ago, it seemed every business was using paper for documentation. Contracts, policies, meeting notes; everything was paper-based - being printed and passed around instead of attached and analyzed via email.

As technology became more advanced, businesses had more storage space for documentation, and the computer systems needed for employees to access these digital documents. This marks the start of a transition away from paper to pixels.

The modern world of digital documentation offers numerous benefits, but problems persist. Documentation is used to convey information, both to internal staff and external customers. This means that consistency of content, ease of access, and ease of management are essential. Contrarily, inconsistent, inaccessible and unmanageable digital documentation can reduce your businesses ability to effectively convey information.

To drive ease and consistency, enterprises should follow digital documentation best-practices. This encompasses the design, formatting, choice of file types, and governance of digital documentation.

In this eBook, we will discuss best-practices for digital documentation and the potential business impact of making these changes. Can better digital documentation drive revenue growth and attract customers? How can businesses transform their digital documentation to deliver better value to customers using a documentation management system, or DMS?

Let us answer these questions!

Digital Documentation Benefits
==============================

Before we discuss the what and how of digital documentation best-practices, first we should understand the benefits of digital documentation:

- **Ease of Management** -- Digital documentation is easier to manage than paper documents. Paper documentation requires space in the office for a filing cabinet, and requires manual archiving for each paper document. Digital document storage frees up office real estate, and simplifies management with search functionality and folder structures.

As detailed in this Software Advice study, office workers spend an average of six hours per week searching for paper documents. Additionally, office workers spend an average of eight hours per week creating reports from paper documents, with 94% saying that a document management system (DMS) makes this process easier.[[1]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn1)

- **Ease of Access** - These digital documents can also be shared, virtually in real-time, via email or cloud storage. This negates the need for posting letters, eliminating postage or courier costs. It also increases the speed of response, as recipients no longer need to wait days for a letter to arrive. Furthermore, digital documentation can be deployed on your website or social media, improving ease of access for customers.

Did you know that - according to Gartner - for every $1 spent on printing documents, another $6 is spent on handling and distributing these documents? Furthermore, half of all printed documents are thrown away within 24 hours.[[2]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn2)

- **Security and Governance** -- Unless its hidden behind a lock and key, paper documentation is insecure. Anyone can read it, make a copy, and share as they see fit. Contrarily, digital documentation can be governed by role-based access controls (RBAC) to grant access only to those who need it.

Even Governments are not immune to paper data breaches, with the US Department for Veterans Affairs attributing paper documentation as the reason for 98% of data breaches[[3]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn3).

- **Environmental Benefits** -- People and businesses alike are searching for ways to reduce their environmental footprint. Digital documentation is one route they can take. According to Green America, paper consumption has risen by 400% in the last 40 years, with the industry accounting for 4% of global energy consumption[[4]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn4). By opting for digital documentation, businesses can reduce their paper usage to combat deforestation -- keeping trees alive to absorb carbon emissions and sustain animal habitats.

**Best-Practices With Digital Documentation on Docsie**

Digital documentation has the capacity to transform knowledge sharing, publishing, and marketing across the business. To tap into this potential, businesses should follow digital documentation best-practices:

Align Your DMS With Business Needs
----------------------------------

A document management system (DMS) is the foundation that helps businesses store and manage their documentation. After content is written, it is uploaded to a DMS for storage and distribution. A DMS centralizes documentation storage, providing a single source of knowledge for the entire business. This functions much like a digital library, categorizing documents by department or product, with search functionality to streamline knowledge sharing. From here, marketing and support teams can share documentation, publishing it on websites and social media, or in response to customer queries.

Docsie is a DMS that simplifies the way your team does docs. Every business needs a way to store and share documentation, both so internal staff can learn about their job role, and customers can learn how to use your product or service. HR onboarding documents, product how-to guides, sales communication templates -- all of these items can be stored and published with the right DMS solution.

What documentation currently exists on your products and services? Do your staff use templates and frameworks when communicating with customers? Can you easily store, internally share, and externally publish your documentation? Ask these questions when considering a DMS solution like Docsie, and ensure that your DMS is aligned with business needs.

Focus on Compatibility
----------------------

Digital documentation can increase accessibility, but only when using highly-compatible file formats. This is important with downloadable documentation, as certain customers may be unable to open a file. It also applies to internal documentation, where one employee using PDF and another using DOCX may cause file format fragmentation -- prompting other employees to switch software packages, or convert to another format to make the file accessible.

Open file formats like docx, xlsx, and pptx for Microsoft Office, or the open document format (ODF) for OpenOffice are ideal for maximizing compatibility. Adobe PDF documents are common, but less compatible due to requiring a PDF viewer. Consider who will be accessing these documents, and store documentation in a format that caters to the widest possible user base.

Docsie is a great option for broad document compatibility. When text is loaded into the Docsie Book Editor, it is stored in the open-source JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format. You can find more information on exporting documents, and how Docsie enables easy conversion into DOC, PDF, Markdown (MD) and HTML formats [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/exporting-content/).

Actionable Feedback
-------------------

User and employee feedback on documentation is vital. If documentation lacks information, contains incorrect information, or is simply hard to read -- readers will struggle to get any value from your documentation. Furthermore, feedback can help you improve existing documentation to provide more value to customers, driving business success through quality knowledge sharing.

Docsie Vocally is an all-in-one feedback monitoring and response service. It allows readers to rank individual pieces of documentation on a scale of one to five, with comments to explain the reasons for their rating. Docsie Owners and Admins can read this feedback, gaining insight into the success and shortcomings of your documentation.

Self-service knowledge bases are designed to minimize support requirements, but this also means that customers are unlikely to persist with bad documentation -- instead searching for an alternative with competitors who provide better documentation. To tackle this problem, Docise Vocally will record user interactions as they read your documentation. This will highlight where they encountered a problem in a document, and what content is causing the problem. Writers can use this feedback to edit documentation and act on user feedback. Over time, this will improve the quality of documentation knowledge, empowering customers to help themselves.

Customer empowerment is a great way to attract new business, reduce costs, and retain customers. Around 67% of customers prefer self-service to speaking over the phone, according to Zendesk[[5]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn5). Forrester Research and Oracle also found that self-service can drive down support costs by $11 per call[[6]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn6). Finally, a study from Microsoft highlights how 90% of customers expect a self-service option[[7]](file:///C:/Users/Ciaran/Google%20Drive/Articles%20Work/All%20Articles/SoSEO/Docsie/Docsie%20Content/eBook%20-%20Digital%20Documentation%20Best%20Practices%20to%20Inform%20and%20Inspire.docx#_ftn7).

Summarily, customers prefer and expect quality self-service, and providing this option can significantly reduce support costs. By creating a self-service knowledge base in Docsie, and improving documentation quality with feedback through Docsie Vocally - you can cater to evolving customer demands through digital documentation.

**Document Versioning**

Particularly with technology companies, new software or service versions can introduce problems with documentation. The new version may include different workflows to previous versions, or different terminology that may confuse users. Concurrently, new documentation may not apply to older versions of your services, creating knowledge gaps that have the potential to frustrate and drive away customers.

This is an important best-practice with digital documentation. Customers may need older versions of your software for compatibility with their hardware, or simply choose to not update to a new version. Thus, businesses should always cater to their user base regardless of the version number being used.

Docsie tackles this problem with document versioning. When you update a document in Docsie, you can retain previous versions for redundancy purposes. Customers on version 2 of your service can select the right documentation, with customers on version 1 still having access to older documentation. This is called fragmentation; when your customer base is split across multiple versions of the same software. Docsie reduces the impact of fragmentation, ensuring knowledge is available no matter the version being used.

Document versioning ensures the right information is available when needed. It also helps with traceability, especially when multiple writers are working on the same piece of content. Versioning also reduces duplication, consolidating your documentation for ease of access.

Does your business regularly update its documentation? Are your customers struggling to find the right information for current and historic versions of your software and services? If so, it may be time to apply the best-practice of document versioning through a DMS like Docsie. You can find more information on Docise document versioning [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/docsie-editor/managing-versions/).

Workforce Documentation Habits
------------------------------

Your people create documentation, but they can also create problems with documentation. During the draft phase, writers may use different font sizes or types, or outdated iconography and artwork. These differences are easy to miss for employees that work with content every day, but customers are more likely to notice. The result is inconsistent documentation, driven by inconsistencies in the approach to content creation and publishing across your workforce.

Docsie helps businesses tackle content inconsistency with the Docsie Documentation Hub. You can set a default font type and size, add company logos or artwork, and define CSS style sheet parameters for use on a company website or knowledge base. These choices will propagate from Docsie to any web page with Docsie embedded content, using the same colors, fonts and logos everywhere your content is published.

This simplifies content management and publishing workflows. Rather than editing individual pages, businesses can set a content design framework once in Docsie and apply those changes everywhere. This is known as centralized management or orchestration. The process of editing each document or page individually may seem doable for smaller content libraries, but this process will not scale efficiently as the library grows in breadth and depth.

In summary, Docsie works to futureproof your content management workflows by minimizing low-level administrative workloads. By starting with scale in mind, large content libraries can be managed with simplicity - setting content design frameworks once and deploying everywhere with Docsie. You can find out more about Docsie Customized Documentation Hubs using the Docsie Manager [here](https://www.docsie.io/docsie_manager/).

Centralized Documentation Storage
---------------------------------

On the topic of centralization, document storage locations can help or hinder management and publishing workflows. You may store documentation on an intranet or SharePoint site, in Dropbox or Google Drive, and on-premise or cloud storage partitions. Each option here works in isolation, but can cause chaos when used simultaneously.

An employee needs access to a document. The document is stored on a SharePoint site. The employee downloads it and saves it to their account storage partition. A business file synchronization tool uploads this to the cloud automatically. The employee sends the document via Slack to a colleague. That's four copies of the same document in circulation on your IT network, with decentralization across four different services or tools.

Docsie tackles this decentralized chaos by centralizing documents in a single storage location. When you upload a document, Docsie places the document on a shelf. We refer to documents as books, with each shelf filling up with books to form a content library. Employees can log into Docsie to find all of your documentation, with filtering that delivers relevant documentation by department or seniority using role-based access controls (RBAC). From here, employees can publish documents directly to your website, edit documentation text, check different versions, and view feedback from customers or colleagues.

Now, when an employee needs access to a document, all they have to do is open Docsie. They can search for documents, export in common file formats, and share direct links to Docsie books or shelves. For external users, they can be invited by Owners and Admins for direct access to authorized Docsie books and shelves, without compromising on security. It's like folders and files on a hard drive, but with a little Docsie magic! You can find out more about Docsie shelves and books [here](https://www.docsie.io/features/).

Document Governance Risk and Compliance
---------------------------------------

Most documentation will be created for the public domain. Still, some documentation may be confidential. This presents the need for governance risk and compliance (GRC) management. GRC policies can be used to govern access to confidential documents, control document permissions for writers and readers, and prevent accidental publication of documentation in the draft phase.

Docsie uses role-based access controls (RBAC) to govern permissions on the platform. This is how Docsie helps businesses manage GRC workflows, by defining user roles and assigning permissions based on seniority or department. These roles include Viewer, Editor, Admin, and Owner. Viewers are granted read-only access to documents, with editors being granted read and write permissions. Admins can assign roles to manage who is allowed to read, write or both per book or per shelf. The Owner can manage every user and document in a Docsie organization, and is the only user role that can delete an entire organization. In this example, the organization could be Docsie, with shelves containing books on different functionalities in Docsie.

In conclusion, GRC is important for managing access to documentation. With too little access, employees will be unable to work on documentation. With too much access, employees may accidentally publish unfinished documentation, or gain access to confidential documents that are reserved for executives and managers. Docsie helps you strike a balance between access and security, making the platform suitable for storing any type of document.

This document is sensitive, how can I prevent unauthorized access? How can I give my team write permissions, while only giving other teams read-only access? A freelance writer needs permission to edit this document, how can I do that? If your business is asking these questions, Docsie has the answers! You can find more information on Docsie permissions management [here](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).

Team Collaboration
------------------

Content is rarely crafted by a single person. When multiple writers are working on your documentation library, collaboration is critical.

What processes do your employees follow when working on documentation? An example would be searching on a network drive for existing documents and downloading to a computer. Next, the writer may send a final draft via email to a colleague for further proofing. The approved draft may then be uploaded to a content management system (CMS) ready for publishing. Later in the day, someone notices a problem and sends an annotated version back to the writer via Slack. This workflow may work, but it can be simplified.

Docsie reduces the number of tools you need with comprehensive team collaboration functionality. You can find documents in Docsie, write and edit, share changes with team members, chat and annotate, and publish to the internet without ever leaving the Docsie dashboard. This negates the need for downloading, uploading, emailing, and managing a CMS -- allowing you to simply manage your docs with Docsie! Team members can be tagged using @mention, chat conversations are isolated to each Docsie book, and external freelancers can be invited with ease for full team collaboration in any location.

By minimizing the number of tools required, employees can focus on creating content instead of switching between software. This expedites content creation workflows by minimizing wasted clicks, with comments and suggestions from colleagues being easily accessible in the right-hand toolbar. No more link sharing, no more outdated versions of documents, no more lost emails or chat messages -- everything to do with your docs is centralized in Docsie.

Apply Best-Practices to Your Docs With Docsie
=============================================

Imagine if you can take all of the valuable information that’s scattered across your enterprise in emails, physical folders, shared drives and more, and put it into one easily, accessible location. And then, allow your employees and customers to leverage all of that information to their benefit.

At its most basic level, a knowledge base is a digital library of carefully curated information that can be stored, organized, searched, modified and shared. When viewed in the context of enterprise infrastructure, it’s the epicenter of all of your enterprise’s knowledge and one of the most frequent ways your stakeholders will experience or interact with your enterprise.

There is no question that in today’s world, enterprises that want to function efficiently need a knowledge base. You just need to know what type of knowledge base you need and how to create it.



### What Type of Knowledge Base Does Your Enterprise Need?

**Employee Knowledge Base**

An internal knowledge base consolidates enterprise knowledge and the collective know-how of employees. It is a must-have if you want your employees to have access to the information that can help them do their jobs as seamlessly as possible. You can include any sort of information that has to be shared within your enterprise, such as:

* Employee handbook

* Product catalog

* Best practices

* HR policies

* Onboarding training for new employees

The knowledge base should also promote collaboration between your employees, giving them the capability to pose questions and provide answers to one another.  

![](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/smkjimvctbbblpexslsg)

Why is this so important? There is no enterprise that doesn’t benefit from its employees being more productive and more engaged.



**Customer Knowledge Base**

You have to let your customers help themselves. Why? Because they want to. According to Gartner, [70% of customers](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/rethink-customer-service-strategy-drive-self-service/) use a self-service channel at some time in their journey to a resolution. 

Any content that can help customers understand and use your service or product should be included. This includes, but is not limited to:

* How-to articles

* FAQ sections

* Glossaries

* Case studies

* Video tutorials

* White papers 

An external or customer-facing knowledge base will not solve *every* issue your customers may have with your service or product, just the most common ones. So, whenever you begin to get the same question repeatedly from customers, save your customers and employees a lot of time and just put the answer in the knowledge base. 

**Why Not Both?**

You may find that your enterprise will benefit most from a knowledge base that is a combination of the two. Of course, you wouldn’t want all of the information on the knowledge base to be accessible to all users. 

For example, do your customers really need to know about how your enterprise’s HR policies for addressing tardy workers? Even within the information posted for just employees, it may be necessary to limit some employees’ access to certain parts of the knowledge base due to their job title or the department they work in. If you are working with the [right documentation platform](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/), this will be no problem because you’ll be able to manage access to certain information by applying user [permissions](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/workspace-administration/managing-and-understanding-permissions/).

 

### Factors to Consider When Creating Your Knowledge Base

Creating the knowledge base your enterprise needs isn’t just something you can throw together, post online and expect to function as it should. It takes a bit of reflection, planning and *the right tools* to get it right. Take a look at some of the factors you should consider when developing a knowledge base.** **

**Enterprise Issues That Would Be Solved By a Knowledge Base.** Do your customers seem to ask the very same questions repeatedly, affecting employee productivity and customer satisfaction goals? Do your employees find it difficult to do their job because they have to search multiple places to locate the information they need?

**The Core Content Elements of Your Knowledge Base. **You should conduct a full content audit to determine exactly what type of content is floating around your enterprise, if the information is still accurate and what information is missing. And remember, the content will not make the impact you want if it's not in its best form, no matter how valuable the content is.

**Organization and Structure of Topics and Articles. **A knowledge base should be structured in a logical way and be consistent so that it is easy to navigate. Look to your brand so that the information your post into the knowledge base has the [same tone and visuals](https://www.docsie.io/documentation/styling_guide/). 

**Metrics to Determine the Success of Your Knowledge Base. **How else can you be sure that your knowledge base is doing what it is supposed to do? The metrics that you will use can vary, depending on the purpose of the knowledge base, but here are some examples want you may want to monitor:

* Search activity, including search keywords

* Content performance based on type, ratings, visits and page views

* [Real-time actions of customers](https://www.docsie.io/gather_feedback/) on the knowledge base** **

**The Right Software to Create and Manage Your Knowledge Base. **The documentation platform you use to develop your knowledge base should be able to scale along with your enterprise. It should have the functionalities to incorporate the features you want in your knowledge base. Let's take a brief look at [Docsie](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/).

### Using Docsie to Create and Customize Your Knowledge Base

Docsie is a dynamic documentation platform that unifies documentation creation, content management, and content integration into one seamless platform, making it easy for you to create and maintain a knowledge base. Look at how easy it can be: 

* We mentioned earlier that collaboration should be a key function of an internal knowledge base. Docsie, provides a [built-in chat function](https://www.docsie.io/markdown_editor/) in its editor to encourage and improve collaboration between teams.

* If your target audience is global, you can have your knowledge base content [translated automatically](https://www.docsie.io/self-writing-documentation/).

* This is how easy it is to [publish](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/publish-documentation-portal/): simply use one line of code to publish your knowledge base documentation to your enterprise website or app. That’s it. Really.

* Remember how we said that you should be able to analyze how your users interact with the knowledge base? With Docsie, you can also receive insights based on predictive documentation AI to enhance your documents to improve those interactions.

If you create an optimal knowledge base, your employees and customers will know that you have valuable information and that you believe that their access to that information is a priority. The knowledge base will serve as one of the faces of your enterprise, so it is worthwhile taking the effort and using the right software to ensure that it works.

5/4/2021 16:12:56,Tal F.,"Are you in charge of educating and training your coworkers, clients, or new hires? If that's the case, keep reading.

It can be difficult to share and educate others. Especially if you don't have a good example for a training manual template to get you started quickly. In this article, I'll show you how to increase productivity and decrease downtime by using Docsie to create a simple training manual template and sharing it with your team.

## Step 1: Create an account with Docsie (it's free).

##

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_wX9JoNbS1HNZqB1vU/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/964e0589-ee96-b0fb-6fdd-d760b5e81f53image.png)

Docsie is a simple training manual development tool that provides companies with reusable templates to help them develop better training manuals. To get started, it's completely free, and you can build your first training manual in under 10 minutes. Once you are signed up we can begin to explain how to write a training manual through Docsie.



## Step 2: Create a book to make an awesome basic training manual template.

Docsie is based on the concept of books and shelves, with books serving essentially as instructional manuals and shelves serving as departments and knowledge base hubs.

Assume you're a busy sales team with a need to have all of your outbound training materials in one place. You may use Docsie to organize and categorize your training manuals using sets. You can then invite the rest of the training team to collaborate and build better training manuals together once you're ready.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_qd5uDhTnzIv7i7usI/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/eeee9ae3-949a-4a68-ff86-1774bdad3340image.png)

## Step 3 - Define training instructions

This is where you'll identify the training categories and pathways you'll need to create to order to educate your target audience.

Keep in mind that this guide assumes that you already know who your target audience is; this guide's aim is to show you how to easily build content for your instructional training manual.

Consider a sales force. It has beginner and advanced sales tracks for a variety of positions, including SDRs (Sales Growth Representatives), Account Executives, Customer Success Representatives, and so on. The positions can have different names and responsibilities depending on the nature of your sales company, but they all require training manuals and a traceable way to share information.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_G26esoODDFXA7gBlw/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0bbdb8bd-8fa4-5057-8bb2-4816e06b647aimage.png)

As a result, once you've identified your training tracks, you can start interviewing experts in those positions to help you determine the content for those tracks. As an example, you could interview an account executive to learn more about how they work.

Once you know their everyday routine, practices and duties you'll construct a process diagram that details the tasks of that specific job, giving you a clear picture of those responsibilities.

You'll then break down those duties into actionable steps by stage/seniority, which will make creating a training manual a breeze because you will know what and how to write a manual for your specific team.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_h2VzPUoPrfLAgyWSZ/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/426f2d7b-d360-d8d2-3042-01b6797217c2image.png)

Once you have completed gathering enough information, you can use it to develop your training material using a training manual template.



## Step 4: Develop training materials

Following the outline and road map you drew up for yourself in the previous steps, and armed with the information gathered from your team. You will begin to fill your training and instruction manual template prototype with content, stage by stage, gradually expanding each stage to help your trainees develop a proper training base.


Different articles can devise different steps in Docsie to illustrates in training manuals. There are many great tools that work together with Docsie to help you easily build amazing manuals.

Docsie Guides will also assist you in creating non-coded guided tours to demonstrate how to use your product to consumers or new trainees.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_8ae41KnpRQi0C0u7t/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/9fbb3165-564b-a2c7-66db-1076080930a04ddd50e0_12bf_9027_3986_78792c015969Gifs_optimized.gif)

## Step 5 - Publish your training manual and share it with your team

You must want to share your training material with your new trainees and/or customers now that you've developed it in Docsie. It's as easy as clicking publish and having it appear on a Docsie embedded page on your site.

If you want to limit access to all of your training material, you can do so easily in Docsie. You can also allocate a unique password to a particular trainee and revoke access at any time.

With only one line of code, you can also insert your training material directly into your company's intranet using Docsie.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_SReYm8UdA6cJ9A6PX/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0323cf4c-d72e-5b5c-5e0f-fcf03d027ce4image.png)



## Step 6: Collect feedback on your training manual and update it on Docsie.

Once you've released your training manual prototype, you're ready to go. You may want to learn how your trainees and/or customers communicate with your training manual and give them the chance to provide you with actionable feedback so you can better your job.

This is where you can use Vocally (a Docsie Extension) to collect video clips of your trainees' training experiences to better understand how they deal with your instruction manual template. You may also give them the option of providing input on their training experience, which will be categorized in Vocally manager.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_OqJHxdveDITl5by25/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/0a5ecb60-0b4b-1bf9-f1c6-d9a0a1357ca5image.png)

You can then use Vocally Manager, which is easily incorporated with your project monitoring software, to build actionable tasks for yourself to update and refine how you write a manual based on user feedback.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_ULxUK3nJlSUujhpeo/file_TCiT6UQygjeRreFqY/boo_WxwzJSt3rqWegFPsx/b0696bf6-153e-b42a-4933-97fd097dd59eimage.png)

## Step 7: Maintain and translate the material of your training manual.

You can now translate your instructional manual templates into multiple languages right on Docsie, and you can even communicate with experienced content translators who can help you update your content at a discounted rate.

Furthermore, creating new versions of your training materials in Docsie is as easy as clicking a button as your training materials grow. As a result, you will not lose any more valuable training copies and will still have a point of reference to refer to.



## Final Thoughts

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543386650-2be9a18d2750?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGZpbmFsJTIwdGhvdWdodHN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjIwMTU3MTg3&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Docsie can be used if you are serious about making excellent training manuals and use instructional manual templates. It will significantly simplify and improve the workflow of your training manual.

Instructional manual templates play an important role in employee training by informing new employees about the organization and its procedures. Employees are maturing and learning new technologies, techniques, and processes.

Employees who aren't actively learning or who aren't knowledgeable about the devices, applications, equipment, or machinery used by their company may become disengaged at work.

However, disengagement often leads to high employee turnover and poor work satisfaction. In the end, both the employers and employees suffer losses.



Not to mention, there are statistics to back this up:



Within a year, 40% of workers with inadequate training quit their jobs.

Because of a lack of growth opportunities, 74 percent of workers feel they are not reaching their full potential at work.

Employees consider contributing financially to training in 72 percent of cases.



According to 68 percent of employees, the company's most important agenda is growth and training.

Just 13% of workers worldwide are engaged.



Employee disengagement costs the economy more than $500 billion each year.

The numbers, on the other hand, are endless. The problem is real. Employees want to grow and improve their skills in both traditional training and developmental opportunities.



A great way for businesses to get started on this much-needed method is to create a fantastic company training guide or training manual.



We need to get down to the point and figure out what the most important aspects of a fantastic training manual would be and how to write a manual.



In 2017, 45 percent of learning hours in a typical company were created by online or even e-learning methods, according to the ATD (Association-for-Talent-Development-in-the-United-States). In comparison to 2015, this represents a 42 percent increase.

Hi Everyone!

On my last video I spoke about how to create product documentation and edit your product documentation. Also I showed you how to embed videos, pictures, media as well as code so that you can create product documentation so that you can further educate your customers about your technical platforms and solutions.

Now I wanted to take a deep dive in Docsie product documentation platform and show you how to create software documentation simple and easily.

Here is a quick tutorial on how to explain how to publish with Docsie.

Publishing with Docsie’s knowledge portal can be done in a few ways. In this video I explain how to publish with Docsie’s knowledge portals, books, shelves or articles with one simple line of code.

In this example I wanted to publish this specific book called 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vghRPvDGV9FcXW5sq/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/8baf35b2-88ce-eb21-1eca-e13454c076beimage.png)



As you can see in my current already created software documentation I have written a version called 'Brand new portal that I am working on"" and if you click on the 'pencil' tool near it you have the option of making your published portal 'active' or 'primary' or turning these features off. which is awesome because that means you and your team can write your or update your documentation and not have it visible to your customers or clients until you are ready to have it published your created product documentation in production on your website:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wpue5g2itHdkeHQWH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/e1957632-a49c-efea-8206-7ea31886a8dcimage.png)

That that I you are ready to publish its time to deploy your documentation!  This is done easily by first clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the Docsie platform, and then clicking on your account:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Vyh10Vht9p5HgACri/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/cc784b29-8edd-ade4-807c-cb6a30b61998image.png)

Once you are on your Profile and settings page,  click the tab entitled ""Deployments'. this will bring you to the deployment page and help you get set up on creating your embedder code that will be placed upon your website.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_FOdT3hJo8ygjq6lYH/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed142930-2a7b-b56c-0ccf-3183c6191179image.png)

Now click ""Configure a new deployment +"" 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vbyck51UPHrWOVomu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/c3affc72-9cdd-b8ee-4c51-5798f54e5688image.png)



Great! Now that you have access to the dashboard all you need to do is deploy a custom domain this is done easy by opening the ""Deploy a domain: tab bar and clicking 'custom deployment'

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Xlx7uCVpKiy3TJbaI/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/30f5281a-702a-9bd4-a926-9440f1aaef22image.png)

Now the next two steps are simple: 

1. The first step is to type in your domain (and remember to use http:// or https:// before writing your domain name)

2. the second step is to pick what you want to publish, you have the choice to publish, a Book or an entire Shelf. In this example I am publishing a book entailed: 'Writing your first Django app, part 2'



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Tac6kZ9pjFovGo8Ut/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/2d5ad6d7-27fc-c487-f6bc-b97d7f1be44aimage.png)

Great! Now the last step is before getting our code is to click ""+More Options""



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_OrYP2ugvhlurWxfbJ/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/390a98c1-f554-9ae3-7e09-8faed42d93a2image.png)



Now you can use our various plugins, features and other documentation options to spice up your knowledge portal and make it more handy for your users. These features,  plugins and  product documentation tools are quite nifty and make your knowledge portals more robust.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wy76iK9zPT84NoPdu/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/ed41417e-41dc-cffc-161a-4ffa182d3796image.png)

note: you can change these additional features and plugins and other product documentation tools any time. 

Once that's done click 'Create web portal'.

Now scroll down to the bottom and click ""+ Get deployment script""



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lv7JtNkP26EPzxBTw/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/6196219b-ddb3-55b8-d15f-3b08276ebbc2image.png)

And copy your script and paste it into your HTML:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_C7q3zLB0gXrf4HObS/boo_IPAeUSAJvs2JsOCoT/550abafc-23f2-e1f3-138a-7435eca30e4fimage.png)

7/2/2021 11:35:48,Ciaran Sweet,"Product teams and software teams both share a common bugbear: documentation.

Product documentation refers to user-facing manuals and guides which explain the workflow and user interface of a product. How can the average user be productive with this product? In this sense, product documentation could be used for software products.

Software documentation refers to the underlying technologies, prerequisites, and configurable attributes of a software product. How do IT administrators configure, monitor, host, and deploy the software product for users? This type of documentation is important, especially when multiple versions or branches are added into the mix.

In a sense, product documentation is like teaching someone how to drive a car. The wheel turns the car, the accelerator pedal moves the car, the brake pedal stops the car. Software documentation teaches someone how the car works. The wheel is connected to the front axle which turns the front tires to alter the course of travel; the accelerator increases airflow to the engine which draws in more fuel, generating torque and horsepower.

Both documentation types are important. One educates users, and one educates administrators and developers. It’s great showing people how to drive a car, but if nobody knows how the car works, what happens when the car breaks down?

## Minor Differences Between Product and Software Documentation

There are minor differences to be aware of with product and software documentation:

### Software and Product Documentation: Target Audience and Persona

Product documentation caters to a single audience; the user. It assumes the user has no technical knowledge, communicating in plain English with minimal jargon. Much like a technical apprenticeship versus a university degree, it educates people on how to do things, with less focus on theoretical or conceptual knowledge.

Software documentation is targeted to IT administrators, engineers, and developers. It covers the design and architecture of software, command line setup instructions, API and integration support, data management and reporting, network topology – basically the cogs that make the machine work. These documents form a single-source-of-truth (SSOT) that IT personnel can refer to when monitoring and troubleshooting the software application.

### Software and Product Documentation: Update Frequencies

Software documentation must be consistently updated as new commits are merged into the main release channel. The software documentation must highlight new functions and commands, and deprecate old features. New or changing dependencies should be documented, and feature support across all target platforms should be clarified – such as one feature working on Windows, but not Linux.

Product documentation only needs updating when underlying software edits trigger a change in workflow or usability. A developer changes the code for a payment gateway, but the payment process for users stays the same, so no updates are needed.

This shows a natural hierarchy for software product documentation. Technical software documentation forms the foundation, and subsequent product documentation is based on this foundation. Therefore, the focus should be on making great software documentation, as it breeds even greater product documentation.



## Example Formatting Frameworks for Product and Software Documentation

A piece of product documentation could follow this framework:

* *Product Name*

* *Overview of Product Purpose*

* *Setup Guide*

* *Feature 1 Explanation and Images*

* *Feature 2 Explanation and Images*

* *Customer Support Links*



Similarly, a piece of software documentation could follow this framework:

* *Software Name*

* *Overview of Software Purpose*

* *Software Dependencies*

* *Installation Guide*

* *Function 1 Explanation and Images*

* *Function 2 Explanation and Images*

* *Technical Support Links*



Clearly, these two documentation types are closely related to each other and follow a similar structure. This means that product and software teams have a lot to learn from one another, and a lot of potential when working collaboratively on documentation.

## Product and Software Documentation Teams Can Complement Each Other

There are stark similarities between product and software documentation. This presents the question: can product and software teams work together?

Yes, they can, and they should!

Software teams understand the technical jargon and underlying technologies. Product teams understand what users see, want, and need; the user experience. Software documentation writers can provide detailed technical information, and product documentation writers can dilute the technical details for consumption by a layperson audience.

Imagine trying to explain something in laypersons terms, without having the high-level understanding needed to formulate something a layperson would understand. That is what happens when product documentation is created before software documentation.

What is quantum mechanics? Schrodinger’s cat is probably the first thought in your head! But what does quantum mechanics have to do with cats? To the user, it’s not important. To a physicist, it means everything.

## Start With Software Documentation, End With Better Product Documentation in Docsie

To conclude, there are many benefits when using software documentation as a template for subsequent product documentation. Software documentation should act as a single-source-of-truth for IT personnel and product documentation writers. After it is written, product documentation writers will have the clarity and understanding to simplify and share user-friendly knowledge with customers, with technical guidance for proofreading and quality assurance.

Simply, by starting with great software documentation, your writers can craft even better product documentation!

Don't Worry, They're One in the Same!",1,,1,,
7/2/2021 11:46:42,Ciaran Sweet,"As a first port of call, any business selling products should ask how they can create product documentation. Documentation itself is a priceless tool, enabling businesses to share targeted knowledge with their customer base. When a business excels at knowledge sharing via digital documentation, it drives a significant customer-centric competitive advantage.

Consider any existing marketing or sales materials your business uses. These materials are non-authoritative and purpose-built to promote your products, and your customers know this. Contrarily, product documentation acts as a showcase for your product and its underlying features. It warms up cold leads in the sales funnel and facilitates cross- or up-selling of your extended product portfolio. Simply put, product documentation gives your brand authority, instilling trust in prospective and persistent customers alike.

This is proven by an IEEE study which highlights how product documentation satisfaction directly correlates with perceived product quality. The better the documentation, the more convinced your customers will be of product quality!

Do you have product documentation already? Either way, let us explore how to showcase the awesomeness that is your product using product documentation!

## Product Documentation Formats

Depending on the complexity of your product, it may be worthwhile using a specific product documentation format:



### 1. **All-In-One Product Documentation**

All-in-one product documentation is suited to companies that sell products with low complexity. Much like the Yellow Pages (used to) have every local phone number, all of the information for your product is contained within a single document.
If you have no product documentation, an all-in-one user guide will merely suffice short-term. As your product grows in scale and complexity, this format will likely become unsustainable. This is a prime example of putting all your product eggs in one documentation basket; what happens when the basket is full or breaks?



### 2. **Self-Service Knowledge Portals**

Anyone who works in customer service will know that self-service knowledge portals offer immense value to the business. Customers agree, with 89% of surveyed customers in the US expecting a knowledge portal to be available. In laypersons terms, this means customers want access to structured digital product documentation with search functionality. Without it, your customer service team will be inundated with simple low-level product questions.

When using this format, product documentation writers should structure content for readability. Short, concise answers beat long-winded explanations, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) should be front and center on the knowledge portal homepage.



### 3. **Contextual Product Documentation**

To maximize customer satisfaction, industry leaders go one step further than a knowledge portal. Contextual product documentation involves integrating knowledge directly within your product. When a user loads the settings menu for the first time, contextual documentation could provide a step-by-step walkthrough detailing each function. Alternatively, a knowledge portal could be embedded in the sidebar of your page, enabling knowledge searching without any extra clicks.

Contextual product documentation does take time to develop, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. This Forrester study shows how 73% of respondents think valuing customer time is critical for good customer service. Contextual help does value customer time. It eliminates clicks and provides immediate knowledge; helping customers start doing more in less time.



## Build Your Customer-Centric Competitive Advantage in Docsie

Whether you have existing documentation, or no documentation at all, Docsie is a great place to get started! Docsie offers customer-centric collaboration, extensive embedding, tailored translations, and powerful publishing – all at your fingertips.

### Understand Customers by Facilitating Feedback 

Understanding breeds empathy, and understanding your customer base breeds awareness of their needs. To understand, you need data.

Docsie enables customers to write feedback on documentation, and collects this data via Docsie Vocally. Here you will find comments on your docs, a rating from the reader, and a video recording showing exactly what the reader was looking at.

Data leads to insight, and insights guide action. Use Docsie Vocally to elucidate customer feedback and maximize the value of your documentation.

[Vocally by Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/jsfiddle.net?doc=/using-docsie/quick-start/#header-three-dcdes)

![Docsie Vocally Feedback Form](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hfqdsijgxnujiyvnbfdo ""Docsie Vocally Feedback Form"")

### Structuring Your Knowledge Portal

A knowledge portal is only useful when it’s structured for easy navigation. Docsie provides structure using Books, Shelves, Workspaces, and content blocks.

As an example, a ‘Getting Started’ Book could sit on the ‘First Time Setup’ Shelf. This is contained within the ‘My Product Name’ Workspace. You could have another ‘Administration’ Shelf in the same Workspace, with a Book named ‘User Management’. By structuring your documentation using these Docsie features, readers can easily scan through and search for relevant information. Add as many Books and Shelves as you need; the sky is the limit!

Finally, why publish text-only documentation when you can enrich it with Docsie content blocks? Move your customers with moving, interactive elements on the page! Along with standard text editor formatting like headers, lists, and bullet points, Docsie Editor allows for extended tooltips, image or video integration, and iFrame script embedding.

[What is Docsie Editor](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/#section-header-two-ee89i)

### Centralize Your Docs and Perfect the Art of Publishing

With large quantities of documentation, decentralization can lead to disaster. By centralizing your documentation, employees can craft and edit content with ease. More importantly, this also helps with publishing.

Docsie centralizes documentation for ease of access using Workspaces. An entire Workspace, or individual Shelves and Books in said Workspace, can be published with two clicks. These documents are stored and hosted using Docsie servers, offering high availability and reliability for peace of mind. When your writers make changes, they will automatically propagate to your live Docsie knowledge portal. Advanced users can optionally self-host, enabling greater branding customization and more technical page element integrations.

![A live view of a Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ztrwbdcjznqcqkgofnhz ""A live view of a Docsie Portal"")

As part of publishing, versioning allows for ‘evergreen’ documentation that changes as your product changes. When you update your product from version 1 to version 2, your docs will follow illustrating any changes. Customers can learn about new features thanks to this, and even refer back to older documentation if they use or need an older release of your product.

![Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/fgzcadbebafclhvtrhvf ""Publish Books and Shelves context menu in Docsie"")

### Contextual Documentation Enriches the Customer Experience

Have you ever used a product, only to open a new tab and search for how to use that product? That product lacks contextual documentation, and it made you do extra work to figure it all out… not good!

Docsie users can leverage [TourGuide.js](https://github.com/LikaloLLC/tourguide.js/) to offer guided tours to customers, all without leaving the main product dashboard. The result is akin to an integrated knowledge portal, overlaying within your product and sharing contextual advice to get users up to speed faster.

How to customize your Docsie portal by injecting your embedded Docsie code into Visual Studio Code.

Docsie has a lot of customization capabilities. In this article i will guide you on the steps you need to take to get started on customizing your Docsie portal. Please keep in mind that i am not a professional developer, or designer and know that your tech team can use these tools to create beautifully fashioned Docsie portal far better then I can. This is merely a step by step guide on how to get them started!

## STEP 1

The first step is to get your line of code. He is how it is done. Find your account on the top right corner where there are three dots and click it. It will take you to Docsie's settings dashboard.

## STEP 2

Next, click on 'Deployment' button on the left hand side.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_UNFgmrrV4LJRPPcLD/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/f551ad37-a3a0-78bb-f97a-1246d5d57899Snag_1113a5f7.png)

Once you are in the deployment settings now you the ability to create a knowledge portal via Docsie cloud, or to create a knowledge portal via your own companies website by summoning a line of code in which you can add to your HTML and begin the styling process. This is done simply by clicking 'Configure a new deployment +'

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_66sDikYE16JfYewXU/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4a8b6dd2-03d2-5d7a-837d-e3afdbe66900Snag_11161d31.png)

## STEP 3

Next click on the tab that says 'Custom deployment' type your website within 'Deployment URL' and then click 'Create web portal'.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6CGgetG9GizkqY87p/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4b102fcb-a424-8966-1f92-59b56e14241dimage.png)

Once that is done, make sure to scroll down and find your portal at the bottom of the list of portals and then click 'Get deployment script.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_el02yIrEUA3rf28CG/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a64fc5d5-4e2c-9c6a-8325-6ed88a291db3Snag_1119813c.png)



## STEP 4

Now copy your script and lets jump onto Visual Studio Code!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_a3ExYoQ3yZSLnkf4y/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/1a26f697-45e9-b0c4-53d2-8ad808b8d49fSnag_111a44da.png)

If you need more information about how to get the Embedded code from your Docsie check out my blog about publishing your documentation with your embedded code[ here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/publishing-product-documentation-with-docsie/)

Now, within Visual Studio Code create a file (unless you have a file ready) for index.html, index.css. and index.js. Once that is done open your HTML and paste your code within the body of your html (under the </head> tag).

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ss2981O27UrVWVfrx/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/64bda798-9915-3b7b-274f-dc707b9118a2Snag_111c041e.png)

## STEP 5

Now for step 5 we need to create a 'Basic style'.

You can find more information about how to apply basic styling to your Docsie portals via our link here [https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/docsie-styling-guide/base-style/)

For my example I added this to my HTML. and as you can see I added a company name link and I did some mild CSS to alter them.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_xg25e1fVbKEZbjJYl/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/a49b8d34-7911-10aa-741a-781224f57212Snag_1122dccd.png)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_fRoPLO0Df6JhTcf2h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/7c668c24-8d5e-8fdf-5b2a-ad93de3b313cSnag_11238581.png)

My results look very basic, but I wanted you to see the potential that your tech team can do to spice up Docsie knowledge portals and create portals that match your brands look and feel. Keep in mind that you may have a different style, and colors; in fact in most cases our users put their logo which is embedded with their website links, they add navigations bars on top so that their Docsie knowledge portal fit seamlessly and naturally onto their company websites and match the environment and CSS of their current sites.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_StvlIomWiDjQ8wV0h/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/e02de6be-1990-cbe1-7078-4e477ec4a6d9Snag_112473e8.png)

## STEP 6

Then the last step I did was add some styling changes via this text here:

```
  <style>
    :root {
        --docsie-font-family: garamond;
        --docsie-font-family-head: inherit;
        --docsie-font-family-mono: monospace;
        --docsie-hue-primary: 200;
        --docsie-hue-gray: var(--docsie-hue-primary);
        --docsie-sat-primary: 100%;
     
        --docsie-page-width: 1800px;   
        --docsie-notice-background: var(--docsie-color-primary-darker);
    }
    </style>

```
I pasted it below the last div tag of the ‘basic style’.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ORs7jTN5WvXJ7VkuB/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/4cc0127b-2bca-4d38-3040-864b8f5054fdSnag_112741dd.png)

And the results for my very basic style changes were this:

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_uCSLHwdeVry8finx8/boo_OKQpsM12uk8DtYPzL/82ffd090-9575-e89b-b0ed-16f4af08a405Snag_1127954c.png)

Now that you have all the tools at your disposal, give it a try yourself, and see how it feels to change things around and create beautiful knowledge portals that you can be proud of! I am 100% certain that your knowledge portals will look way fancier then mine! :) So give it a try and most importantly have fun with it!

Customer feedback is the forefront creating and optimizing appealing product documentation that your customers understand, and use to aid them with the use of your SaaS or physical products.

A lot of times companies are scared to knowing what their customers truly think about their documentation and this leads to a roadblock in finding out what their customers truly think about their product docs.

Why is this important? Why do we need to learn about what our customers feel about our product documentation?

If you own and operate your own company I'm sure you go out of your way to delight your consumers, to meet their demands, and to keep them loyal to your business. But how can you be certain that your efforts will yield the intended outcomes? You will never be able to provide your customers with the ideal product documentation experience if you do not try to find out what they think about your service. Their feedback on their experiences perusing and browsing your online documentation with your brand products is valuable information that you can utilize to better tailor your product documentation to meet their demands.

You may use client feedback to your advantage in a variety of ways. In this article, I'll try to illustrate why gathering client feedback about your documentation, whether prompted or unprompted, is critical for managing customer happiness and loyalty, customer retention, product and service improvement, and many other aspects of your organization. Continue reading to learn about the advantages of product documentation feedback.

What does product documentation feedback entail?

Customer feedback is information supplied by customers regarding their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product documemntation, user manual and any online documentation provided to the customer by the company. Their feedback can help you improve the client experience and tailor your activities to their demands. This information may be gathered through various types of surveys (prompted feedback), but you can also locate and collect unprompted feedback from your clients by employing Internet monitoring technologies, such as Vocally – a feature within Docsie that allows you to observe how your customers react with your online published documentation. Both sources are necessary for obtaining a complete picture of how your clients view your brand.

Top-performing organizations recognize the importance of consumer input in their operations. They pay attention to their clients' voices on a regular basis. They not only look for thoughts that clients post on social media and reviews that they offer on feedback-gathering websites (such as TripAdvisor), but they also ask for input directly through various types of questionnaires. If you want to keep ahead of the competition, you must always pay attention to consumer feedback, whether favorable or bad, prompted or unprompted.

## Why is it important?

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531537571171-a707bf2683da?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fGxpc3RlbmluZ3xlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjU2MDEwMTg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Many SaaS and engineering products have a variety of user guides, user manuals and other version of product documentation which they provide to their customers. This documentation can be translated in to various languages, and have many versions. So why is it important to know what your customers are thinking when they are looking at your companies product documentation? Simple. Product documentation are designed to explain how your product works, and if this explanation is not comprehensible to your clients it could lead to churn, and clients who are annoyed with reading your documentation. Feelback helps to narrow the gap between their misunderstanding and optimizing the documentation so that they can comprehend the material in a more comprehensive manner. This essentially makes your customers happier because now they understand how to use the product documentation as it was indented and it instills a trust in using your brand, which shapes your companies reputation in a positive way.

Secondly, knowing feedback can deliver the product manager, product owner, technical writer and even tech team with information that they can use to help improve the product documentation outlay, as well as content to increase and optimize for higher comprehension. This is always the goal when publishing product documentation.

The following are the top seven reasons why client feedback is critical in the business world.

### 1.  Customer input aids in the development of better products documentation.

You presumably have an idea of client demands when you first bring a new product, brand, or service to the market. Market research conducted before to introduction may help you determine whether or not potential clients would be willing to purchase it, as well as provide you with suggestions on how to enhance it. After launching your products you now need to make suitable user guides, online product documentation by sharing your knowledge portal with your clients online. You hire a technical writer to write information about your product. A translator to translate it and get your tech team to display it online. However, you will only hear about all of the benefits, faults, and their actual experience after your consumers have used your products in correlation with your product documentation and provided you and your team with the necessary feedback.

This customer feedback provides insight into what aspects of your product documentations are performing effectively and what changes might be made to improve the experience. Your professional knowledge may be the finest in the industry in which your firm works, but consumer insights will always be more useful to finely polished product documentation that your customers will understand. Because you are really close to your products its good to get their feedback assists you in ensuring that the final product documentation meets their expectations, solves their issues, clears up any misunderstandings the products has and meets their requirements.

### 2.  Client feedback aids in the evaluation of customer satisfaction level.

Customer loyalty and happiness are important factors in determining a company's financial performance. It's connected to a slew of advantages, including improved market share, cheaper expenses, and more income. A number of studies have found a strong link between customer satisfaction and corporate performance. As a result, there's no doubt that you want to ensure that your customers are satisfied with your product documentation and understand how to use your products effectively. Getting their feedback is, of course, the greatest method to see if you've met their expectations. You can simply assess the degree of satisfaction and, as a result, anticipate your company's financial situation in the future by using rating-based inquiries.

NPS is one of the most accurate techniques for measuring, managing, and improving customer satisfaction that has been used by many organizations. The statistic is based on a single question that asks if a client is likely to suggest a brand to a friend. The loyalty questions provide response possibilities ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 signifying highly negative and 5 reflecting extremely positive. Because this technique is both easy and ubiquitous, it may be used in customer satisfaction management by any company. Vocally uses this rating as well, and additionally allows our clients to recorded videos of how their customers use their documentation. This information is highly essential and also gives companies the cutting edge in analyzing their customers feedback and delivering on future optimizations of the product documentation.

### 3.  Collecting client feedback demonstrates that you care about what they have to say.

By soliciting comments from your customers, you demonstrate that you value their input. You include them in the development of your company, products and product documentation/user guides so that they feel more connected to it. You may strengthen your relationship with them by listening to their voice. This is the most effective approach to recruit important brand ambassadors who will help you spread good word of mouth. And I'm sure you're aware that relying on their recommendations is probably the most successful and cost-efficient approach to gain new consumers and increase your trustworthiness in the eyes of present and future customers.

People enjoy it when you inquire about their satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) with the way your company formulated your product documentation. It demonstrates that you appreciate their viewpoint and are here to help them, not the other way around. They believe that your main purpose as product documentation is to solve their misunderstandings, and helps educate them on how to use your products effectively which is a proper approach to customer retention.

### 4.  Customer input aids in the creation of the greatest possible customer experience.

Today marketing is strongly influenced by people's interactions with products, services, and brands. People do not purchase brand name items just because they are excellent. They seek for quality customer service, user experience and over all good understanding of the products specifications and use case which matches their needs. They purchase the confidence to push their boundaries farther. Clients will remain loyal to your brand if you focus on offering the finest customer experience at every touchpoint. And, of course, the most effective approach to provide customers with a wonderful experience is to ask them what they appreciate about your products documentation which demonstrates the uses of your products and what they think may be improved. This is even more so for SaaS products which have many facets and technical aspects. The more educated your customers are the more they will understand the uses or your products and the more they will want to stick around and maintain loyalty.

### 5.  Customer feedback aids in the retention of customers.

Customers that are happy with your service will continue to do business with you. Unsatisfied customers who don’t understand your product documentation, and consistently get confused with how to use your product will ultimately seek out a better option to your company. Customer feedback may help you figure out where your customers are getting confused with your product documentation and what made them happy with the knowledge portal of your products and identify areas where you can improve. You can always maintain your finger on the pulse if you ask for comments on a frequent basis. When a disgruntled consumer expresses their dissatisfaction, you can respond quickly and find a solution to their problem. This is an ideal time to reclaim a customer and perhaps improve their degree of loyalty. In many situations, a dissatisfied client who had an issue with your products, services and or user guides which explain them but was promptly resolved displays greater loyalty to your brand than a consumer who has never been dissatisfied with your products or services.

### 6.  Customer feedback is a trustworthy source of data for other consumers.

In the world of marketing, gathering analytics and feedback it is highly essential to collect useful data and information to opt for optimizations and continue increase retention and bringdown churning rates. Consumers no longer believe advertising or expert advise in the age of social media. These days, the opinions of other consumers who have utilized a product or service are a more credible source of information. When you are looking for a place to stay in a city you are visiting or a beautiful new restaurant to dine with friends, you check reviews first. When you want to buy new shoes, you ask for advice on Facebook or read a review on a reputable site. Reviews apply to any business, especially SaaS products. Many businesses now include a review system as part of their services and products. This ensures that not only their brands can be shaped by the reviewers but also that they can work hard to gain trust of new customers and attempt to claim them for the long hall. Customer feedback is just as essential to your business as it is to other customers, so make sure you and your clients can easily access comments and evaluations.

### 7.  Customer feedback provides you with information that assists you in making company decisions.

When our customers viewing our documentation click this button and send us feed back, their feedback is automatically collected and viewable on our web analytics within Docsie. but that is not all! we can also see a short video of how our customers interacted with our documentation!

Let me show you how!

After our client or customer sent that nice little feedback:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yGdEfZA4ZQSxUAdDV/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/add6328a-0f22-b9cb-dbf4-0ebfc0467ca9Snag_d7b9057.png)

We can see it on Docsie. First thing we need to do is jump onto Docsie’s platform and on the left we can see “workspace, notification feed” and below those tabs we can see “Web Analytics” with a globe.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Uwq3GfsNK7QCj9St4/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/3ab0e698-c291-cb21-0199-d6ab57198128Snag_d7c1bed.png)

If we press it and open the Web analytics’ button it will show us Docises feedback platform:

**This platform shows us everything we need to know about the feedback we have collected, our client who sent it, the date they sent it. And what portal they are referring to.**

1. We can play back the video when we please with this play and pause button.

2. This allows us to change the speed of the video being played. This is especially handy for large documentation portals which are previewed by our customers so that we can quicker pinpoint where they had issues.

3. This tells us what portal they have submitted this feedback from.

4. This is their comment

5. This shows how much they liked or disliked the documentation

6. If you have compiled allow to feed back Docsie allows you show only certain portions you require to analyses based on dates.

7. The configuration button helps us make changes to CSS and other aspects of Vocally’s feedback tool

Lets take a look now at what features Vocally has to offer by clicking on the ‘Configuration” button:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ItXaohEeulWngnN4y/boo_tZD1ykTPGDgzextMB/7ad80a03-ee84-3fbe-27f7-5c09dac0130eSnag_d7dbcdc.png)

**This is our configuration dashboard. There are a few different changes that can be made here.**

1. You can connect your feedback to email, Slack, Mattermost, Zandesk, and Zapier.

2. You can auto record your videos, or turn off this capability

3. This is the strip of code so that you can later on use number 4 to stylize your feedback so that it matches your company’s brands look and feel. Adding a strip of code is only required when you are publishing Docsie via a strip of code for your website. However, if you are publishing your Docsie documentation via our Cloud-based Portals, you will automatically have Vocally injected seamlessly within all your published knowledge portals.

4. This is for stylizing the Vocally.

Now that we have taken a deep dive on the importance of why feedback is nessisary for improvements and optimizations, building trust with your customers and how Docsie provides a solution to all these matters. Please feel free to try Vocally out for yourself. Sign up to Docsie, write and publish your first documentation, and then see how you like it!

7/8/2021 10:41:06,Tal F.,"![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614064642578-7faacdc6336e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDMzfHxjeWJlciUyMHNlY3VyaXR5fGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNTc1MTExMg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Most companies have information, documentation, and projects that they consistently work on with their teams which must be secure while their teams collaborate on their ideas. Also, client information and other sensitive data must be secure, thus maintaining high levels of security is critical for any company. Document security threats can include:

**· Breach of security**

**· Data that isn't structured**

**· Unprotected Documentation**

**· Access to data that is not authorized**

All of this implies that you may be putting client information, customer databases, financial information, or even projects you and your teams are working on in danger.

A lot of times companies work on documentation for their new products and they need this information secure to other company members or subcontractors which they collaborate with to complete certain aspects of a product that is not yet released to the public. Some of these products have pending patents and the need to secure them is the difference between a breach and a future release on a product.

Collaboration and trust in your organization are more crucial than ever. This is becoming a commercial requirement as more clients expect that their providers be safe. While document security may seem intimidating, there are easy actions you can take to guarantee that nothing goes wrong.

## Internal document security risks are the most prevalent:

### 1. Prevent employees from falling prey to phishing scams.

The most serious internal danger is phishing emails. A phishing email is an email designed by a hacker who makes the email look like it is coming from a legitimate company associated with the employee's company and frequently has a link which the victim presses. In most cases, once the link is press this allows the hacker to have remote access to the employee's computer and thus they can penetrate it to get private information about the company and the future projects the company is working on trying to keep private until future release dates.

In a recent [study by North American](https://techaeris.com/2020/12/08/more-employees-clicking-phishing-emails), researchers found out that:

* *“67% of clickers (13.4% of overall users) submitting      their login credentials, also up substantially from 2019, when just 2% submitted their credentials.*

* *The Public Sector and Transportation sectors struggled the most, posting a click rate of 28.4%.*

* *The Education and Finance &  Insurance sectors performed considerably better than others, with click rates of 11.3% and 14.2%, respectively.*

* *Users in North America struggled the most with the phishing simulation, posting a 25.5% click rate and an 18% overall credential submission rate. This means that a      little over 7 out of every 10 clickers willingly compromised their login      data.*

* *Users in Europe exhibited lower click and submission rates of 17% and 11%, respectively.”*

This is a strategy that some nefarious competition companies use to steal product ideas from under companies' noses. Phishing emails now account for about 90%-95% of all successful assaults globally. Hackers pose as trustworthy entities, such as suppliers, coworkers, or even clients, and request sensitive data. However, if you know how to detect them, you should be safe! Make sure you check the sender's email address, not simply his or her name. Incorrect or significantly modified logos, as well as spelling errors and strange emails associated with strangely written websites, are other red flags. Verify the email with your IT staff if you're not sure to avoid compromising any important data.

Phishing emails can also be avoided if the company collaborates on writing product documentation that is password protected and secured by a platform such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/). It allows our customers to create product documentation in a collaboration format while still maintaining security measures and also adds the feature of sharing online documentation that is password protected. This is far safer than emailing such information because emails can be breached.

### 2.  Managing documentations

When access permissions to documents are provided on a need-to-have basis, product document security is at its finest. Password-protected new designs or new projects within product documents with limited access are an excellent approach to maintain a safe document environment. Electronic document management solutions such as Docsie have a lot of potentials. Docsie keeps track of documents and record any changes or other activities done to the document as well as the time and date which is digitally stamped. These trails must be constantly monitored for unusual behavior that might jeopardize product document security requirements.

This also brings up the problem of actual documents being left around the office for anyone to view. It's critical that this does not occur. Ensure that your coworkers properly delete important papers (rather than just binning them) or carefully store them if they must keep them. That is why keeping copies digitally online on a platform like Docsie is a really good alternative than having sensitive paperwork lying around in the office for social engineering hackers to stumble upon.

### 3. Keep an eye out for shared devices

Another source of vulnerability for documentation security is shared devices such as printers and scanners. To reduce the risk, only authorized users should have access to these systems' network applications and resources. Use your current security architecture to protect printers using a password or smartcard-based authentication, reducing the need for additional passwords. Print management software may be used to keep papers in a print queue and keep track of all document activities.

Access to physical ports (USB, flash drive) is also commonly restricted to prevent someone from stealing your private papers or infecting your company's network.

## Threats to patent-pending product document security from the outside can also be mitigated.

Despite the fact that security precautions are in place, documents can be hacked. To prevent security breaches, we recommend following these best practices.

### Keep your data safe.

A company's failure to use an appropriate encryption mechanism can be disastrous. It should go without saying that your company's anti-virus and spyware software is up to date.

Furthermore, limiting Internet access across the enterprise minimizes the risk of employees falling prey to external phishing sites or downloading malware that can propagate throughout the corporation. When public wi-fi is the only option, its also a good idea utilizing a business VPN and creating other security measure on the Wi-Fi network.

### Modify the document's format

According to a 2021 [Thales Data Threat Report](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/en-gb/euro-data-threat-report#download-popup
) , conducted by 451 researchers. They surveyed 2,600 executives in a range of industries and found that that 45% of US companies suffer from data breach at some point in their business life cycle. In 2019, data breach accounted for 65%. And even though from 2019 to this year the breach has been decreased, it still holds a huge problem for many businesses.

Sending documents as PDFs eliminates document format-related delays and transforms digital files into password-protected files with strong encryption and edit permission restrictions is a good way to send documentation back and forth. However, this is not practical if the documentation is product documentation that consistently needs to be altered. PDF does have security measures but using a platform such as Docsie which allows you to direct certain members of the company to manipulate and change documentations via the cloud in a secure way is much more productive. With Docsie you can set certain people to ‘Admin’, ’Editor’, or just a ‘Viewer’ of certain documentation. This will reduce levels of breach because only certain people will have access to and be able to manipulate the documentation. Docsie also allows published documentation can also be password protected so you can have certain people who have the password view the documentation. These measures imply that the user manuals, policies or product guides can't be altered by just anybody other than the document's originator, or Editor, lowering the danger of forgery. When utilizing Word/PowerPoint formats, hackers are unable to retrieve the information of the document creator.

### Choose your passwords carefully.

Stated in a[ article written by Identity Force](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/2020-data-breaches), in December 10th of 2020, Spotify had their passwords reset after finding a software vulnerability that exposed their users' account information. Spotify claims “*may have included email address, your preferred display name, password, gender, and date of birth only to certain business partners of Spotify.*”

This goes to show that even top SaaS companies have weaknesses with password penetration. This is why it is always important to never forget to maintain quality passwords! To prevent changing passwords every three months, our system administrators at Docsie advocate having a strong password policy along with MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). It's also a good idea to remind your coworkers of some fundamental password rules:

Passwords should never be written on sticky notes and then “hidden” under your keyboards.

**Here are a few key notes on making a good password:**

1. Do not use the same password for several accounts and platforms.

2. The more time you have, the better! Check the strength of your password document at HowSecureismyPassword.net. -security-use-strong-password

3. It's critical to make sure that new employees go through an interesting and instructive internal training session that covers both internal and external threats. Employers frequently address this with a simple e-learning programmed or worksheet, but this is not always sufficient to ensure that staff are aware of the hazard.

### Docsie helps with all facets of security with your product documentation development, collaboration, and publishing with the ability to password protect your documentation.

### Here is a short video on how Docsie helps with security as well as creation password protected product documentation:

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7R3WXOnXPE8"" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Lets start with how Docsie’s internal platform helps us to maintain security over how documents are written. As I mentioned above, here are many instances where documents related to new products need to be written and safely protected and secure. These products may not yet be patent pending but the product documentation writing process is still underway. One way Docsie helps with security in regard to this matter is by making certain that all documentation is written, send and managed only by certain parties with certain responsibilities.

Docsie allows the owner of a workspace to set up “Admins” (who can create new books and shelves) “Viewers” (who can only view a workspace and not edit or write on top of projects) “Editors” who can only edit books and “owners” who have all the power to transfers all Docsies capabilities and set members to the various positions within the Docsie project.

This is very useful because it show who is working on a given project and what they are doing with it, as well as limited those who should not be partaking in certain aspects of the project.

This ability is accessible very simple with Docsie. At the top right corner where you see three dots click on your Username:





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZjgXPtSl0RlVBr98x/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/cf10ca9d-cf81-cb56-4ce1-abe88f9919e9Snag_3dc21e.png)

Once you are in the Profile and Setting dashboard, then click Users and it should open the Workspace User Management dashboard:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_LusOK9N4cYs62tmgO/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2a3683cc-6afa-d6a7-f19b-cf810211a89cSnag_3e7ce3.png)



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_0OL56vieZqzTE9UQB/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/72423478-b544-adeb-61e0-15929a28a298Snag_3ef5cc.png)

Now within this dashboard you have the ability to invite new users, change their “Roles” to “Viewer, Editor, Admin” and delete users who are no longer working on a certain project.

Now to add another level of security. All of Docsie’s users who are working on a certain project are will be tracked through our time stamp. This is highly useful for tracking who was editing a documentation, what revisions they made, and what changes they have done. This will tell us who and when someone had interactions with a certain product documentation project. Any form of tracking is highly useful for security purposes because it shares information about who and when someone had access to certain documentation.

It is easily accessible as well. Once book is open click on the circular clock image on the top right corner:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_ZFC7kIcr91dH4Oglw/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/2edc1be5-9f18-dc5a-5205-9e769d5fb8eaSnag_3f7c90.png)

This will reveal a drop down on the right hand side of who and when someone worked on a specific documentation:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_GcHe7Y8M7cLwB7RGd/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/86ed6131-5980-e307-d00a-8479b5f9f528Snag_3fdb4a.png)



## Password protecting documentation with Docsie:

Docsie also allows us to password protect docs.

There are two ways to do so. By clicking in the three dots near your shelf or books.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_9tB3mDhl0WPwFiaht/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/160f814a-13bd-09f0-3e2c-a8b18bfbbab1Snag_4077e8.png)

This will open a settings tab, in which you need to click properties in order to access the password creation dashboard.

Note: if you click on the three dots next to your shelf then it will password protect all the books within your shelf. However if you click on the three dots and then properties within your book then it will password protect the book you have clicked properties to only!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Lo7CM1IekNCDS5rTa/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/17693cea-41e7-2b78-ee77-517b59923cd2Snag_40d605.png)

After you have clicked properties it will open up this dashboard then click “More options”:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_zN9LFzvG5tT00uXjc/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/6949063f-c31b-6650-ab89-bc6e8829f1f5Snag_416f19.png)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_d5dR2xrdTlISl1rzV/boo_1dNh8ka7o63iwmubD/9ce603b3-85e5-1711-24a2-0d290e77f887Snag_418cc3.png)

Once you have clicked more options it will open your entire password dashboard. Now you can type in your password for the book or shelf and enable the password protection. Done! Your books and/shelf will be completely password protected and only those with the password can access it.

But I'm sure you've come across a website or platform that you couldn't grasp as a result of an online search. All you had to do was go to an online machine translation and translate the website's text into your native tongue... Of course, you probably exited (bounced) the website in the end.

Because we live in such a digitalized world, increasing your brand's online traffic and traction is inextricably related to translating your content into another language and making it speak to everyone's wants and requirements. Content translation is a simple way to accomplish this.

## There are many benefits of translation product documentations, here I wanted to highlight a few of them:

When you think about 2022, you probably think of the digital world, because nearly every business nowadays has an online presence through which it advertises itself.

Forbes makes a good point based on a [study ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/)in 2020 by Statista Data that between 68% and 97% of people abandon their cards and do not go through with a purchase. Forbes states, in their [blog](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2021/07/06/is-your-company-ready-to-sell-globally/?sh=1c88a3957439), that they surmise that the only customers that “check out” and purchase the products is due to them having the ability to read these product information/documentation in their languages, and pay with their currencies. “In my experience, customers often “click out” or continue at checkout based on whether the information on the product is available in their language, whether they can pay in their currency and whether their preferred payment method and shipping methods are available.”

Due to the fact that we live in such a digitalized world, increasing your brand's online traffic and traction is inextricably related to translating your content into another language and making it speak to everyone's wants and requirements. Content translation is a simple way to accomplish this.

## Now lets go through the list of benefits of translating product documentation:

### Selecting the proper translation strategy so that you may expand the market for your translation

Of course, online translation tools is your first choice when it comes to getting your translation done fast and simply, but why compromise on quality when you can have it all?

It needs a better grasp of the myriad of cultural subtleties and layers to get your point across when translating into a new language. When dealing with exceptionally high-level accuracy translations into Asian languages, such as Chinese, one pertinent example of ‘how not to' translate into a new language is when dealing with China is renowned as one of the world's most antient cultures, based on profound Confucian teachings on the body and soul.

Choosing a translation technology and translation marketplace provider who can add a deeper understanding of these cultural undertones to the linguistic aspect will not only improve the translation of your message into a foreign language, but will also help your brand gain traction by making it resonate with the target audience's cultural framework and identity.

### Having your product documentation translated into a foreign language can enhance customer trust and increase the revenue of products.

People all across the globe prefer to consume information in their native tongue. Meeting this expectation at times can be a legal obligation and also provides an ‘open door’ police to all nations to partake in learning from product documentation, user guides, and overall knowledge portals that companies have online.

Translating your material into a foreign language may provide consumers with a pleasant multilingual experience, increasing consumer trust in your business and, as a result, increasing revenue, as online users are more inclined to buy when accessing information in their own language.

Users visiting on your sites and reading your content will experience a sense of familiarity and resonate with your brand, giving your business a consistent competitive edge and driving it ahead of the competition in order to enter numerous markets.

### Improving your documentation portals by translating them into a foreign language boosts SEO/SEM reach to other countries.

In today's digital world, Search Engine Marketing and Optimization is a major struggle, especially when it comes to the requirement for content to penetrate target markets and reach the intended audience.

Effective multilingual SEO/SEM strategies can be accommodated by translating your product documentation and other content into various language combinations, the more popular and high-ranking the better, multiplying your chances of achieving higher rankings and better search results, which in turn generates more exposure for your brand. Having product documentation that is translated into various languages offers your company with a cutting edge of targeting countries that do not have access to similar physical or SaaS products but require a translated version of product documentation to learn and use such products.

### The addition of a second (or more) language to a website's content can result in a considerable boost in traffic.

If you read [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117106531769704150), you may have come across Neil Patel, he is considered as one of the top 10 marketers in the world. In one of his [blogs](https://neilpatel.com/blog/translate-content-different-languages/), Neil claims that his traffic grew by 47% in only three weeks after he translated the whole content of his website into 82 different languages. Check out his blog, you can find a lot of other helpful tips.

This makes total sense since the reach of the content has become completely global and reach non-English speakers of the world. Based on a graph I found on Languagenobar English speakers only hold 26.8% of the entire world population. This means that if a company can translate their product documentation into Mandarin, Hindi/Urdu, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and Punjabi that they will increase their reach by 58.4%. Which means they will reach over 4.3 billion potential customers. This is huge!

![World's Top Language](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_zRn1CEWo1gf6XujH2/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/9ca35a43-2134-b38c-05de-1f7019686a82worlds_top_languages_languagenobar_53c8ec5072196_w1500.jpg)

So based on these facts it is no surprise that companies are earnestly seeking for translation solutions to move their products into the larger global scope and increase revenue, and customer base.

## Higher conversion rates can be achieved by translating into a foreign language.

“*If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart*” said Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela was a spot about this. When your product documentation in the same tongue as your readers and they can't find any other information about similar products in their tongue, of course, they will become your loyal client and be won over, vs. going to your competitors.

![Higher conversion rates can be achieved by translating into a foreign language.](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AFdqLObCzGpuQn9uY/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/77b47adc-04e1-d93d-8035-f19a98815a4bbackground_20870_1280.jpg)

For companies that provide products and services in more than one nation, writing multiple well-crafted technical user guides and user manuals is essential for globalization. No wonder: companies who interact in several languages and with multiple markets already know that knowing the local language and culture of each market is critical to competing worldwide and increasing their product reach. Nothing beats a translation partner that specializes in the topic to assist them in achieving that objective. In a BBC [article](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180403-inside-the-world-of-instruction-manuals), Roger Bridgeman, a former curator in the London Science Museum states: “instructions are there to compensate for the inabilities of machines by employing the abilities of users, and therefore tell you something about the state of both at the time they were produced.”

It's also worth noting that technical manuals come with a wide range of items, ranging from industrial machinery to vehicles and technological devices and platforms. Because user guides and manuals are a means of communication that has a direct impact on the user's understanding of the product and, as a result, their experience with the purchased good, using the right tools to get user manuals translated should be approached as a very strategic decision within a company, as the quality of the translation is directly related to sales success and customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, mistakes in a manual translation might have dire consequences for the client or customer who uses the items; such as causing accidents when handling or using the product, putting the user's life in danger. 

Regardless of the sort of communication breakdown and the potential consequence of a manual translation, one thing is certain: the firm responsible for the product's image will be tarnished. This is done by strategic steps in creating effective user manuals and guides and also translating them well.

This is a concern shared by professional translation companies, 

and as a result, they are prepared to implement a series of quality control stages throughout manual translation projects to ensure that information about a given product reaches the end consumer correctly and accurately in relation to the original content, achieving its goal

### Are you interested in learning more about how these businesses operate? Then lets take a look at the steps below to see what a skilled translation processes are taken in order to accomplish well translated user manual and user guides:



![Translation Image](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8oLMBFJpm1n29PJnO/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/258bbf65-a0c5-a981-05fc-56bdf438257dtranslation_1092128_1920.jpg)

### 1. Correct interpretation

User manual translation platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)have a network of partners that includes the top linguists on the market. Thorough recruitment, screening, and selection procedure with linguists from all over the world are generally used to create this network. Companies such as [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) often use the following procedures when selecting translators: translator selection and résumé analysis; a test to assess the professional's proficiency in the translation source and target languages; and an examination of consistency in following instructions and meeting deadlines. Then, these experts, who are classified by nationality, language, and specialty, are evaluated on a regular basis based on their performance and the consistency of their supplied work. Attention! When selecting a translation partner, the quality of the translators' service must be carefully considered. As a result, do not be afraid to inquire about the qualifications of the agency's linguists in great detail. Also, lets consider language translation tools such as Docsie’s Ghost translator. It is designed to translate user manuals and user guides quickly at a high effective rate. If the product manager and his team prepare user manuals for translation by simplifying the linguistics this Ghost Translator can be a very effective and user-friendly tool that works quickly to translate all documentation as well as create alternative versions for the end-user to read. We must consider this also as a viable option. We discuss more about this below.

###  2.Extensive revisions to the project instructions 

Following the approval of the proposal, a product manager will be appointed to handle steps needed to initiate the translation of the user guides and manuals for their products. This specialist will be in charge of directing members of his team to handle user manual translations, as well as ensuring that the final file is delivered on the companies deadline. Validating the project's scope; elaborating guidelines for the professionals involved with the work; planning the translation in terms of scope, deadline; monitoring the processes, resources, and the evolution of the work; and interacting with the client to clear doubts and reports are some of the main responsibilities of a product manager.

### 3. Meeting the agreed-upon date for the delivery of the translated user guides and manuals

Working on the assumption that the companies have a strict deadline to create, write, translate and maintain their documentation for their end uses platforms such as [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)offers a useful solution that minimizes risks by allowing companies to use our easy-to-use platform and help them take leaps and bounds in speeding up the process in which they translate and maintain there published user manuals. These precautionary steps include making a real-time backup of the documentation on [Docsie’s ](https://www.docsie.io/)secure cloud-based platform and having their teams collaborate on various user manual translation projects effectively.

## Docsie has a comprehensive Ghost Translator that allows you to translate all of your documentation, knowledge portals, user guides and product docs into different languages.

## Check out this video to see how its done!

## Here are the steps to translate your product documentation, user manuals and user guides:

Once you are logged in, press the shelf and book you want translated, in this case I wanted to translate my ""Quick install guide"":

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_5udCDdXWMkuLzAlZl/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/232a9cb5-33a9-3548-b511-1259ae5c1076image.png)

Within the opened book on the left hand side you will see two tabs. The top tab is for versions, and the second tab is for translations:



![Translation versions](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_IiwdOR3z70l7T7fBI/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/a1eaeb07-7def-dec7-774d-cef4b7344d5aimage.png)



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_SD5stoqUyf3ZbpEPj/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/5465db5e-f11f-4214-2700-13c68122088fimage.png)

These tabs will expand and you will see pencil icons  to the right of the version, and languages, as well as an “Add version +” which will allow you to add another version and an “Add language +” button which will let you add another language.



Before adding a language you may notice that English says “CURRENT” below it and French says “DRAFT” below it:



![Docsie' Current and Draft Image](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_hTsq4reqGDozWF3CM/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/6fc2a5df-0875-9d22-d7c7-c40f31cc9505Snag_35e180b.png)

“CURRENT” lets us know that this language is set as primary.

“DRAFT” lets us know that this language is only visible within the Docsie portal and it will not be visible online.

If we click on the Pencil icon next to French we can change Draft to “active” and after updating the draft will no longer appear below the French language which means it will be present when we publish our knowledge portal:



![Draft 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_m4I8ulBxwLmeroluK/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/26f8c524-316d-a5b0-be0a-604d32ab69bcSnag_35eee56.png)



![Draft 2](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_2l92rJQYCw2I7BERN/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/aa76e3d4-9438-ad08-91bb-4f31de03069aSnag_35f238f.png)

![Draft 3](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_vsDy3VpWx9oeknAIb/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/2e56e657-2e60-99c5-66d8-e66e4f54995eSnag_35f411a.png)

As you can see here the French language no longer says ""Draft' which means that it will now appear on the Docsie published portal.



![Docsie published portal](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_U7itpDh0YaJxLwo5h/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/84f2dfc0-8747-36bc-1cee-7b2935a26321Snag_360bd4a.png)

Now to add a language to translate our documentation into is really easy. All we need to do is press “Add language+” button:



![Add language+](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NywQdBTv6s2JrB6MP/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/78ea7719-870e-8f7a-73e8-7a444edf00c6Snag_36169d6.png)

Click on the language you want (in this case I wanted to translate my user guide into Italian) :



![Add language+ 2](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Pd9C2Ef91JmD8C1y0/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/89bc66ac-2a6b-0863-841f-0eb75a5e5511Snag_361fcbf.png)

Once that is done make sure that the ""Automatically machine-translate from primary language"" nob is turned on and then press update 



![Automatically machine-translate from primary language](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_gtU5RhdhWYIoaMKpT/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/ac508735-96fc-c170-8c78-5c97a279c9e1Snag_3634165.png)

Great now we have our product documentation translated into Italian as well. Now by default it will be set as ""DRAFT"" make sure that you turn it from Draft to Active the way I showed in the steps above:



![DRAFT](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_b9y8pFOUrReeZCn1N/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/4117e519-3163-705d-0d9d-73fce39ee52eSnag_36589de.png)



Now that that is done, you can also delete any languages you don't find necessary on your translated knowledge portals. For instance if I want to delete French then I will first have to turn the language into a ‘DRAFT” by making it not active, and then press the three dots and click the garbage bin icon next to the language I want deleted. 



![Icon next to the language](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_kFGUptZJfjWH9kpQi/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/cea50cad-58d2-9327-9028-bd8e0be3a39dSnag_3670aff.png)

Note; remember to checkmark ‘Yes” before pressing confirm.



![Yes](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_B3C2T3v775jtYWV9Q/boo_EILVopOp17tubVBrk/4b830098-7137-1751-f762-de97e5bc5934Snag_368101b.png)

And done! Now you have a translated book which you can show your customers, clients and employees online! The trasnlated documentation will appear in your published knowledge portals!

Collaboration is super important when completing product documentation with your team. Writing the right stuff in the right way with your production team is vital and having the right tools to collaborate is key!

Although the term ""collaboration"" has become somewhat of a cliché in the business world, it is far from a cliche. Collaboration in the workplace leads to productive teams and this is especially the case for producing high-quality product documentation!

Collaboration occurs when a group of people in a product documentation team, such as the product manager, product owner, technical writers, designers, developers, marketers, and other facets that create a well-rounded product documentation team joins forces to share their knowledge and skills in order to achieve a common goal which is to produce amazing and polished product documentation that their customers love to read.

Let’s face it! Whether you need to create product documentation, user guides, user manuals, or show any knowledge portal on your page, collaboration is essential to make sure all the pieces are connected in the right way. And therefore the company’s product documentation outcome is heavily influenced by your ability to collaborate with others.

Let's look at seven reasons why teamwork and collaboration are so critical in the development of product documentation.



## Why collaboration is essential and beneficial in the creation of product documentation?

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484069560501-87d72b0c3669?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fFdIWXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjYyOTExMjA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

### It creates new communication avenues.

Working with new individuals’ different sectors of a product management department with other departments inside your company opens avenues that would otherwise be closed. Finding innovative ways to interact and exchange information is critical to a company's success in producing useful product documentation that your customers will understand and comprehend. Different sources of information and input can be brought together by collaborating with various facets of the company in order to help develop useful product documentation knowledge for your customers. This is why collaboration should be used to create ties across departments whenever feasible.

According to Mark Sanborn, “In teamwork, silence isn’t golden, it’s deadly.” thus creating a more unified, open workplace for your different departments to communicate benefits everyone. Furthermore, it pulls everyone a little closer together and clarifies your organization's ultimate goal, and helps produce amazing product documentation.

### Collaboration allows us to work more efficiently.

Working on your own has many benefits but when it comes to product documentation projects, the lack of information from various departments can be quite detrimental. We can concentrate only on one job without worrying about how much time we'll waste if we get sidetracked or how to assemble a team in time to meet a tight deadline. If the work at hand necessitates independence, then go for it. However, when it comes to product documentation, two heads or even more are better than one, especially when different concepts from the different departments combine together to make polished product documentation.

A Stanford [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub) discovered that even the perception of working in a collaborated setting can boost overall productivity and performance. [Forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2017/06/22/new-study-finds-that-collaboration-drives-workplace-performance/?sh=1f9c6da63d02)also noted that in this study: ""Participants in the research who were primed to act collaboratively stuck at their task 64% longer than their solitary peers, whilst also reporting higher engagement levels, lower fatigue levels and a higher success rate.""

Collaboration, on the other hand, is just more efficient for creating product documentation. We must be ready to confess to ourselves that we will require assistance combining ideas and concepts to create polished product docs. It'll have to be a collaborative effort. This is when teamwork comes into play. It aids in the division of a large workload of many product documentation and/or user guides, the development of innovative solutions to create understandable and appealing product documentation that your customers will comprehend is the result of the big picture.

An organization that prioritizes collaboration to create amazing product documentation that their customers love to read as one of their core values will inevitably mainstream this way of working, resulting in a more efficient (and appealing) product documentation workflow.

### Collaborating for product documentation with a high percentage of retention

Collaboration appeals to prospective and existing workers because it provides the groundwork for a more open, connected, and engaged workplace—perhaps even more so than businesses that are walled and isolated. Your employees will value an environment that prioritizes cooperation, and it will go a long way toward keeping them from searching for work elsewhere.

Also, when it comes to producing quality product documentation, that looks good, is informative, and fits what the customer is trying to learn about companies’ products having the various facets of the company input their information to create this type of knowledge portal is very essential. Marketing can talk about what type of customers are being attracted to the company, what region of the world, and other data they acquired from their analytics and statistics. Product managers developing product documentation for their customers need the most collaborative avenues. They need to know information about the engineering fourth product, marketing and sales of the product, and feedback from customers. In order to create successful documentation, they need to collaborate with these teams and departments to know how the products work, what kind of customers match their product fit and use all this information’s to help guide their technical writing teams, designing teams, and tech teams to create, produce, manager and publish effective product documentation.

People value fostering connections, especially in the process of producing product documentation that is appealing and comprehensive to their customers and clients. We all want to work with individuals we can trust, who understand and respect our viewpoints, and who collaborate effectively with others, particularly those with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. Simply, collaboration allows this to happen.

### Collaboration improves your company's morale.

People will naturally trust each other more as links are formed across teams and departments, which will progressively raise the mood of the business as a whole. After all, if there is a lack of trust, bad synergy, and poor morale in an organization, it will fail. Working with people outside of your team or department on a regular basis is one of the most effective methods to establish trust.

This also works in reverse: the better your company's morale, the more likely your employees will feel at ease working with colleagues from different divisions. This is also appealing to high performers, who are increasingly seeking more open, participatory workplaces.

Create useful methods to collaborate and your teams will not only be productive but they will also take pride and joy in working with your organization.

### Collaboration assists us in problem-solving.

When you're stumped, what do you do? Assume you've made significant progress on your product documentation project, but you've hit a wall that appears to defy all attempts to overcome it. You have run out of ideas, development has come to a standstill, and your deadline for the completion of your product documentation is approaching quickly. Do you surrender?

No, of course not; you seek assistance or seek a different viewpoint. You might have a brainstorming/whiteboarding session with your team or solicit feedback from a coworker. To put it another way, you work with your product management team to address the challenge at hand. Product documentation projects that have been halted will begin to move ahead again when your team combines their knowledge, skills, and expertise, then hash out difficulties and discuss potential solutions.

According to a [research study](https://www.adpri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14215554/R0101_0718_v2_GE_ResearchReport.pdf) by ADP, the most quality engagement occur in teams with many possibilities for collaboration and exposure to novel problems.

On the other hand, collaboration does not have to be a last resort. Collaboration should be ingrained in the operations of your product management team. The more eyes that are on a project from the start, the easier it is to spot problems (and solve them effectively).

### Collaboration allows individuals to learn from one another

This is key! Especially for the creation and development of product documentation.

One of the nicest aspects of working collaboratively with people who bring a variety of skill sets and backgrounds to the table is the opportunity to learn from one another's experiences and information they gathered from their various departments. Collaborating with team members or even different teams should be viewed as a learning opportunity to produce product documentation that your customers comprehend and enjoy reading, so make use of it.

This entails soliciting views and ideas, exchanging information, learning how your partners approach their part of the project and getting a better understanding of how they work. Learning from colleagues is not only a benefit of cooperation; it's also the first step in creating a learning and development-focused workplace culture.

Teams that cooperate not only learn from one another—their errors, achievements, failures, processes, and so on—but they also develop a better knowledge of the other team's point of view. You get to hear their side of the story: their problems, priorities, and even how they think. Which will be incredibly useful when you work together in the future.

### Some Reflections:

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595450547833-95af46d7c43a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDQ5fHx0aG91Z2h0fGVufDB8fHx8MTYyNDk5MDE0Mg&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

With many facets and teams needed to work together to create and develop beautiful and polished user manuals, product documentation, and knowledge portals of any kind its highly essential to work as a team.

Many collaborative technologies, such as an intranet, do this. They're meant to essentially open up your company so that all departments can connect with one another and keep track of what other teams are working on via news updates, announcements, events, and discussion channels, to name a few. But what about specific tools that cater to creating product documentation?

Having a cloud-based documentation creation platform that allows your team to collaborate effectively is very essential.  Using [Zoom ](https://zoom.us/)and other virtual video technologies are a great way to stay connected with remote teams and display changes or issues that arise when writing product documentation.

## Foundational Concepts Of Successful Product Documentation Teams & Collaboration

The world is revamping the way we work on product documentation. Especially in terms of how we collaborate.

The majority of labor has grown increasingly team-based as organizations have gotten more global and complicated. Over the previous two decades, time spent by managers and workers in collaborative activities has increased by 50 percent or more, according to research published in[ Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload). This means that communication with various facets of the company happens on a consistent basis. 

In addition, product documentation teams are larger, more varied, scattered and more specialized than ever before. While these product documentation teams might be quite efficient at solving the difficult challenges that many modern businesses confront, some of them still have issues implementing effective collaboration strategies.

So, how can employees today communicate effectively while negotiating the prevalent work structures and dynamics that obstruct efficient workplace collaboration? Let's start by talking about what collaboration is and how it is effectively implemented to increase productivity in product documentation development teams.

### What does effective teamwork in the development of product documentation entail?

Collaboration is defined as when two or more individuals working together to develop or create anything. This can take place in person or electronically, due to the numerous communication technologies and cloud-based applications designed specifically for this purpose.

While there are many various methods to develop and maintain a successful product documentation development team, the most successful ones usually have a few key characteristics. It's an environment where employees feel seen, heard, and free to express themselves and their ideas. Meetings and work sessions are handled efficiently by them. They've put in place standardized systems and collaborative procedures. Their teams are aware of the significance of effective communication with one another. Also, tech teams and technical writers, as well as product managers, have an effective place to see and track product documentation being written on products as well as user manuals for their products. 

The ability to assign tasks and pin tasks and see what tasks need to be done in a managerial manner also adds a huge boost to the completion of product documentation deadlines and separating roles to help foster completion.

Most significantly, these firms' management recognizes that effective workplace cooperation to develop effective, comprehensive, and polished product documentation benefits not just their staff, but also their customers who will better understand the use case of their products and how to use them.

## Let’s explore the advantages of Collaboration.

Ensure that your team is working together efficiently in the office may appear to be a no-brainer.

Still, bringing individuals from various backgrounds and, depending on the size and structure of your organization, different time zones together to work toward a shared objective is no easy task. However, the benefits of good workplace communication and cooperation far exceed the disadvantages.

### Teams add more strength to effectively creating product documentation.

What do some of the world's finest products have in common? They make an effort to build an effective product documentation team to educate their customers about the effectiveness of their products.  Whether a companies product is a non-tangible SaaS software or a tangible product having their team working toward a common objective not only instills a strong sense of purpose in team members, but it also allows them to fill in each other's skill gaps and split up tasks to play to everyone's strengths. Why is this important for product documentation? Product documentation has many facets to it. It has technical aspects; it has linguistic aspects as well as design. By combining the technical team, with the design team and technical writers who are all managed by the product manager and product owner you have a force to reckon with, and they can create amazing product documentation.

### Collaborated product documentation teams are more skillful and knowledgeable.

Good collaboration teams have the chance to acquire new skills from one another, which helps them to advance in their entire personal and professional growth. The act of collaborating forces individuals to think more critically, explain themselves more clearly, and learn more about their abilities, all of which can aid in the development of self-awareness and a better knowledge of their strengths and shortcomings as well as increase their understanding of the products being sold.

Product documentation team members that have a mix of different cultural views are more likely to achieve success. These include people who have lived in a variety of places and speak a variety of languages, as well as those who have strong roots in the region in which they are working and promoting their products.

Translating product documentation into various languages and then having a team who understands these languages is an effective way to polish documentation based on these factors to better reach the heart of customers who live abroad.

### More creativity is needed to produce quality product documentation.

More and more businesses are forming teams that bring employees from all departments together to explore issues and come up with fresh ideas that will help create comprehensive and appealing product documentation that their customers love to read.

Not only can efforts like these help organizations harness the talents of the various departments and views, but studies indicate that groups create quicker, see faults sooner, and come up with better solutions to issues than individuals working alone.

### A more positive customer experience

A well polished and versed documentation which can be viewed in different languages, and versions. Also, with all technical aspects of the documentation simply displayed in a methodical manner and presented appealingly to the customer will increase customers using products and understanding their use case. This can all be achieved with effective teams creating product documentation that jives with all aspects of their customers creating technically sound explanations, that are displayed well and expressed in different languages and to different cultures. This can only be accomplished by a strong team that works well together to communicate their ideas about the different facets of a product's production and customers' use cases.

Happy customers who understand products usages, especially technical products, will give good reviews and essentially become loyal customers for the long hall and through word of mouth share their positive experience with others. This will essentially increase the revenue stream and foster a good reputation for the company.

## 6 virtues for effective collaboration

While the abilities listed above might help you collaborate effectively and create amazing product documentation, working well with others isn't only about what you do, but also the process in which you and your team implement them. The attitude with which you and your team approach collaboration may make all the difference in the world. Next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to collaborate with your team, keep these ideals in mind.

### 1. First and foremost, efficacy

Meetings are a very well pronounced necessity to collaboration, despite the fact that meetings are a necessary part of teamwork, they have received a poor name through time. As a matter of fact the Harvard Business Review stated in their research study that people send a ton of time in meetings, phone calls and responding to emails. The [research ](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload)states: “How much time do people spend in meetings, on the phone, and responding to e-mails? At many companies the proportion hovers around 80%, leaving employees little time for all the critical work they must complete on their own. “

And who hasn't spent an excessive amount of time at a meeting that seemed pointless? Several actions may be taken to transform your team into a high-performing machine of productivity. Having meetings well scheduled throughout the day via priority is a very useful way to set up meetings and tackling issues as they arise.

Also, a daily scrum helps to let everyone know what their tasks are and what issues they may be having as well as what they have accomplished the day before. The scrum is useful so that no one can step on each other’s toes for tasks that need to be completed as well as allow everyone to share their ideas about how to help manage certain situations.

Another method is to ensure that each meeting or phone conference has an agenda and that specific goals are well defined.

Finally, don't forget to assign action items to everyone participating in the product documentation project at the conclusion of every product documentation project that has been completed. This way the team may talk about strengths and weakens tat need to be worked on for the development of the next product documentation so that it runs more smoothly the next time around.

### 2. Explicitness

It is uncommon for all members of a team to be on the same page from the start. Individuals naturally have their own priorities and interests. That is why it is critical to establish everyone's objectives and agendas in advance in order to develop a common denominator that will propel the project ahead.

### 3. Positive Attitude

Simply because a collaborative effort failed in the past does not mean that it will fail again. Shake off any residual hang-ups and embrace each group work scenario as a new beginning, with an open and optimistic mentality. Positivity is contagious just as much as negativity. However, positivity inspires growth, inspiration, and fosters good work habits which will essentially increase overall company morale. Be positive and reward positivity!

Of course, we all have our off days, members who have their off days should be given space so that they can contemplate and transform their off day into a good day for the next meeting day. This is not a loss, but a win! Because one off day is better than an off week. And if one-off day can be recovered so that the next day the employee will be on point then that will work in the long run, and the employee will appreciate working for the team a lot more.

### 4. Fostering Trust

Individuals must feel secure in giving and receiving real constructive criticism, feedback, be motivated by a shared purpose, and have the tools and chances to interact. This can only occur in a trusting atmosphere in which employees believe their colleagues and leaders are looking out for their best interests.

### 5. Insight and emotional intelligence

Each team member plays a critical role. Nonetheless, teamwork can break down when one or more team members believe they are being treated unfairly or that other team members are attempting to tear them down. The more you learn about your coworkers and have an understanding of how they operate and the problems they face, the more likely you are to collaborate successfully.

### 6. Productivity

The most successful organizations have systems and processes in place that allow workers to refer to the schedule and duties of a project in order to have a clear knowledge of how their contributions impact the group. This way, if deadlines are missed or someone is not carrying their weight, the situation can be immediately handled.

Now that we know what a good collaborative team looks like and we know how it should be structured let us take a deep dive into creating certain processes that will help foster an amazing collaborative and effective product documentation team!

## 5 Powerful Processes To Creating An Effective Collaboration For Product Documentation Creation Team

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583506573326-f44ad9661e45?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGZpdmV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjI2MjkxNjg5&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

If you've ever worked on a product documentation project that didn't go as planned, you know that encouraging workplace cooperation is sometimes easier said than done. Perhaps your colleagues work remotely and are inaccessible. Or perhaps your organization is overly compartmentalized, and departments are unwilling to exchange knowledge.

If your company is experiencing difficulties with collaboration, one of the finest things you can do is concentrate on strengthening your soft skills. Believe us when we say that learning these five collaboration skills will make teamwork much easier and more successful.

### 1. Communicate intent

Before you begin work or assignment, ensure that your goals are clear. Inform your teammates of your activities and establish reasonable expectations for when you will complete them—and be sure to adhere to them. These examples of good work ethic will show and pave the way to how work is done within your company. be a good example and communicate your accomplished work and requirements.

Additionally, share any changes to the strategy you have established. If something unexpected occurs and you are unable to produce the expected outcomes, explain these adjustments to your product documentation development team.

Again, this is where having an all-in-one communications tool comes in handy. Also, if your product documentation team can video call and instant message one another from the same app, there is a greater likelihood that they will communicate promptly when an issue arises:

### 2. Establishing objectives

When working in a team, it is critical that everyone understands the project's goal and vision, as well as how success will be measured. Setting up goals and objectives should be done for small aspects of projects as well as large ones so that all objects can be tracked with deadlines and optimized to increase productivity.

Also, if someone is working hard and meets objectives on time or before the scheduled date make sure to reward them so that their hard work is appreciated.

Transparency from all angles of creating and meeting deadlines and objectives, from the start fosters trust and helps guarantee that everyone is dedicated to succeeding and working toward a similar goal.

### 3. Listening attentively

When you work closely with people, you must pay close attention to each team member's ideas, criticism, and advice—and answer with consideration and respect. That is the concept behind listening actively and with intent.

While you may have your own views about how you want the product documentation project to proceed or who should do what, you must nevertheless consider your colleagues' perspectives. While you may not always agree with the conclusion, you must ultimately choose the group's needs and obligations over your personal desires.

### 4. Solving problems

Occasionally, situations arise, and individuals make errors. It occurs. When difficulties emerge, try to carefully assess the situation as a group without criticizing any particular individual. Rather than that, spend your efforts collaborating to discover answers. This contributes to the development of trust between team members and ensures that everyone feels comfortable speaking and being honest with one another, even if they make a mistake.

### 5. Effective time management

Collaborating with others requires you to be accountable not only to yourself but also to the members of your product documentation team who rely on you. Here's when time-management abilities come in handy. Prioritizing your tasks and scheduling them appropriately is critical to meeting deadlines and completing the job that your team is relying on you to perform.

Numerous technology SaaS companies struggle with the process of developing and distributing product documentation (user manuals, user guides and/or tutorials) to their consumers.

Often, this occurs as a result of a lack of knowledge or process about the proper handling and production of manuals, or even regarding who is accountable for them.

As long as there is the need of tools and software exist in this world, we will require effective communication to effectively convey to others the usage, development, functioning, and architecture of these goods. If you wonder why this is, the answer is simple. It is due to the fact that technical communication skills are crucial to collect information and enable the audience to comprehend the product or technology more effectively.

While communication in the actual world is made by speech, body language and emotion expressions, in the virtual world technical communication takes place through technical product documentation!

The only aim of technical product documentation is to facilitate the user's understanding of the working dynamics and architecture of a product and technology. It's more like a ""how to use"" handbook for your new workers, users/customers and anybody else who has to be aware of the working methods, a thorough description of the nut and bolts of a product!

It is the product managers duty to take upon himself/herself the responsibility of developing a team to create, manage, publish and maintain polished product documentation.

I am sure every product manager has said or has heard the following in their department: ""Product documentation is a component of the Product Owner's obligations""; ""Each development team should document their own apps""; ""the feature has been deployed, has the manual been updated?"" or, much worse, ""there is an error in the technical documentation.""

Clearly, technical product documentation might be a bit puzzling as straightforward as it seems! While individuals attempt to solve or argue about the lines in the preceding paragraph, manuals and tutorials deteriorate, which is detrimental to your ""product/company"" image.

To assist anyone experiencing similar issues, here are some procedures to implement to optimize your product documentation.

## What is the purpose of product documentation?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_AkCWDsRGayFUwrjU6/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/1945711f-8493-b2f6-a461-26ddae0b04acidea_3310390_1920.jpg)

When you're talking about product documentation for a technological product or service, you're talking about the information that describes it and the data that pertains to it.

Technical documentation, or product documentation, is all about helping your audience and customers utilize, read, understand, and utilize your product. Most product documentations, of course, are produced in diverse areas including engineering, medical, information technology, and marketing.

The great technical product documentation helps your audience navigate your product and enable them to utilize it without complications.

One other consideration is that technical documentation is critical for customer assistance and contributes significantly to your company's branding and confidence. When they're most in need, users search for technical documentation. The audience uses your product to learn about the processes and deal with issues.

This means having thorough and comprehensive product documentation which is dynamic with search capabilities is very important



## What are the different product documentation

This section allows you to see what kind of product documentation you need for your customers or clients.

There are many different product documentation types that meet the need of different types of use cases and user needs:

**Product User documentation:** This consists of user manuals, how-to guides, tutorials, FAQs, release notes, and training manuals, as well as operating procedures.

**Corporate documentation:** [Surveys show ](https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/why-policies-and-procedures-manuals-are-dead-and-what-you-should-replace-them-wi.html)that over 8 out of 10 companies, out of 1000 businesses surveyed use formal policies and procedural manuals. 

There are many other corporate documentation which comprises of documentation referring to companies policies and procedures as stated in he research above, instructional manuals, technical practices, behavioral and ethical documentation. As well as legal documentation which could be password protected. Also companies structures, best practices, and procedures, as well as maintenance manuals

**Developer Documentation:** this type of documentation provides instructions for software product development, functional specifications, technical specifications, documentation, and tools to assist with developer workflow.

Now that we better understand the different types of technical and product documentation let us discuss what the first steps of a solid management of product documentation development process begins with.

### Locate a head of product documentation development

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_PsI4RmXQikpEACQlf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/eccf743b-f84f-655a-e8cb-52655df7bc4ccampaign_creators_gMsnXqILjp4_unsplash.jpg)

A very typical issue is determining who should be in charge of the product documentation, not as someone who just updates it, but as someone who is accountable for the product's quality and success.

While some businesses believe that each product owner and/or product manager is responsible for product documentation, as well as other departments such as development and support docs may also be entrusted with the responsibility of keeping user manuals, user guides and all facets of product documentation current and effective.

The development of product documentation has many moving parts but here we will point point two of them:

1. Who understands how the product operates at all levels (this includes the product development and specifications teams as well).

2. Those who receive input from customers who go through the product documentation and listen to their difficulties, feedback and concerns about understanding the product documentation at hand.

The first part helps us create the allotted product documentation with the knowledge at hand, and this gets sent out to the customer who in return give feedback and initiate the second processes which helps to optimize the documentation.

Sometimes these two points are not perfectly in place, and this produces situations in which the product documentation never receives the necessary attention.

One approach is to designate a person to be accountable for the, product documentation, product manuals and user guides ""performance."" Consider a purchase order that has ""Product Documentation"" as his product. He is responsible for going through all of the company's teams, sketching out how each Product generates its guides and identifying the challenges associated with that process.

The intention is not for this product owner and product manager to be entirely responsible for generating and modifying manuals, but to assist individuals within each team on the with document management.

This individual should study how users interact with documents, offer ways to make updates more fluid, and gather feedback to determine how to enhance each product documentation and explainers with its intended audience.

Having someone in charge of all facets of product documentation, managing the workflow, and the different departments that are required to complete this documentation will increase productivity within the company, establish awareness and educating customers with knowledge portals about the product and over all streamline product comprehension.

### Look at your product documentation as product itself.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_JdDBUtqTll6qYQgc9/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/cd6029ed-9933-9a5f-4007-c4d28888fa5ebram_naus_n8Qb1ZAkK88_unsplash.jpg)

Products exist to deliver a degree of value that meets or exceeds a customer's expectations. Based on [statistics generated by D2WorldWide](https://www.d2worldwide.com/product-documentation-why-do-customers-still-want-it-and-retailers-still-need-it/) 73.7% rate of people rate documentation more helpful than videos, packaging or salespeople when they are looking for information on products that they are considering on purchasing.

Consider the factors that contribute to a product's attractiveness. There are several factors that can affect a product's attractiveness, but for the sake of this article, we will concentrate on three. They exceed expectations in terms of value; their usage generates satisfaction; and they are competitive.

Additionally, same concepts apply to good online product documentation. Product documents that go ""beyond the anticipated value"" illustrate not just how to use the specified item, but also offer solutions that the client is unaware of or does not feel are possible. It is always necessary to see how other companies initiate their product documentation in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.

It is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your technical product documents are unable to grasp them.

Consider that the individual reading the product documentation may be unfamiliar with the range of possible solutions offered by the product or with the market (as is commonly the case with technical SaaS products), and so they must be ""educated"" about those solutions and various options related to the product.

Product documents whose ""usability generates satisfaction"" follow a logical reading pattern suited for their target audience. It serves no use to have the most thorough manual on the globe if it is a 500-page PDF or does not include a Code example and is not dynamically created with search capabilities, and other functions. Collect feedback from the users of your product document and your support personnel. They will ascertain the major areas of stress linked with the reported data.

Competitive product documentation are those that are continually updated using the most effective information exchange techniques. They have amazing features such as built in search capabilities, translations, different versions, embedded images, videos, and much more!

Even if your integration guide is the best written of all technology businesses, it will lack the attraction without an added video, and images and codes which can be copy and pasted for ease of use for your tech savvy clients who purchase your technical SaaS products.

It is always necessary to see how other firms initiate their papers in order to learn from their successes and mistakes.

It is meaningless to have a company that develops unique and high-quality software that is ahead of the competition if the developers and customers who integrate your documents are unable to grasp them in all their entirety.

**Product Documentation feedback**

Effective technical product documentation enhances the end-user experience by polishing the process to understand products and diagnosing any problems with readily available written solutions. When customers trust and understand how to use your products your, they could come back to you in the future when the need arises.

[New research made by SDL](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/) demonstrates that documentation's role in worldwide marketplaces is rising. [The research ](https://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-writing/technical-product-information-impacts-brand-perception-893/)shows that about 53% of buyers make purchases using technical literature before ever trying the product. Also, another compiled statistic from this research shows that 94% of buyers feel that having product information in one single location is helpful and useful. Because of this, each company places equal emphasis on product documentation as well as product development or testing these days.

Even if the documentation has a designated owner who manages the documentation team, they have created product documentation that has been revised and assessed for improved usability, and has been properly updated, you continue to struggle to make your users and consumers comprehend your technical products. This might arise as a result of the users/reader's inability to comprehend how your documents are being read or the queries they are truly asking. This makes one of the most challenging aspects of document composition is putting oneself in the reader's shoes. After all, whomever produces the product documentation should have a solid understanding of the product.

This expertise may cause the writer to overlook things that are not so obvious to the average user. Typically, this occurs when something that is self-evident to people creating the product is not quite clear to those purchasing and using the product.

This can happen in a variety of ways:

**Writing structure or form:** While this may appear to be a subjective word, even the manner in which a handbook is written can create confusion. It is critical to identify the sort of reader that reads the documentation; otherwise, words such as ""Developers prefer examples over descriptive text"" or ""Our documentation is not clear despite the presence of examples and visuals"" may occur.

**Topic organized in manuals:** Occasionally, businesses operating in the same market develop a standardized documentation format. If your company guides do not adhere to it, the reader may have a sense of strangeness.

**Excessive use of implicit terms:** When applied to a handbook, abbreviations may make little sense, even if the phrases are not acronyms. It's difficult to perceive, but some words, such as ""status"", ""id"", ""credentials"", and contain an implicit meaning disguised as explicit. Utilize particular designations, such as ""UserID,"" rather than ""UID.""

**Valid translation:** translation is a huge part of global reach. A lot of times companies create poorly translated user manuals and product documentation that does not match the culture of certain nations or simply the words do not translate the same way it would in English to that particular country. Understanding these subtle nuances can bring the product documentation a long way from unreadable information to a fully comprehensive and translated product documentation.

To avoid such situations, the aim is to develop a solution that gathers and analyses user feedback and navigation patterns.

Feedback tools such as Vocally a Docsie feature is a great way to reive and evaluate navigation patters and survey how your customers are viewing your product documentation. [Learn the 7 golden rules of gathering feedback here.](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/)

This information is critical to update and optimize your user guides, user manuals and product documentation to create a more seamless experience for your customers to learn about your products. Nothing is more frustrating than introducing a new product and discovering an increase in Support requests due to poor manual instructions.

## How to Write Comprehensive Product Documentation

Quality product documentation is captivating, useful and powerful. I would argue that adept documentation is a necessary component of good product management. As much as product managers take a huge part in the development of products, a significant part of success is creating amazing polished product documentation that our customers can comprehend and use to further their knowledge about our products.



### What is going on with most product documentation?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_6UrbmSp116NpfVK1l/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/64a68ac0-4ef1-308c-ad6b-5ce4525f5301jeshoots_com__2vD8lIhdnw_unsplash.jpg)

Many product managers are averse to drafting product documents. The product docs they are familiar with may not have traction with their customers unless more care is taken into making them appealing, easy to read and relate with.

However, a lot of times companies do not take the care needed to create and craft amazing product documentation. Poor product documentation is written for the sole purpose of being written. It employs expansive phrases filled with vaguely acceptable thoughts and poor layout to discourage viewers from interacting with the material. A poor product documentation is created to shield the author from criticism and is a complete waste of everyone's time. And their customers dislike reading it because of this reason as well.

### How do we fix this and write better product documentation which our customers will enjoy reading?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_NSTKBpS5BKDoj224Y/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d83ce28b-38c3-bb53-8a14-2e1212d0fc5cscott_graham_5fNmWej4tAA_unsplash.jpg)

Excellent product documentation is written with the intention of being read. It is succinct. Good product documentation is well-formatted and can be read and comprehended by everyone in the company or customers in three minutes. It avoids jargon and either gives or refers to business-level viewpoint. An excellent product documentation spends time outlining specific use cases which the customers can understand and apply to the enhanced use of the product. It engages the reader and draws attention to underlying issues with well crafted solutions.

### The potency of a well-written product documentation

Where there are small, medium, or big businesses, well-formatted technical product documents may save a lot of time and help employees work more productively. This is generally true of most product-based businesses, who spend a large percentage of their budgets on hiring technical writers and writing technical product documentation.

If your business employs more than two individuals to create product documentation, establishing a culture of good documentation is completely worthwhile. There are many reasons why you would want your team to create, manage and publish well-crafted product documentation but for the section below we will address how effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience.

### Effective product documentation is a low-cost approach to improve customer experience

Solid customer experience is the forefront of keeping and maintaining loyal customers. Most project managers are optimists — they get a concept, become enthusiastic, and then execute. While passion is admirable, and execution seems productive having a game plan before executing proper product documentation is vital.

The first steps after brainstorming a gameplan is initiating a design cycle and structure the product documentation content in such a way that it will be progressively easy for their customers to read. 

Also, to gain feedback from their customers about their current documentation is a vital step needed in order to restructure the docs to match the customers needs. This way project managers can create, manage, maintain, publish and optimize their documentation with perception and automation. This is not a simple and miniscule task, and having amazing tools like [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)which automates a lot of the processes for making product documentation effective is quite essential for success.

Attractive, engaging, and navigable technical documentation helps consumers learn the product in less time, which increases the likelihood that they will set up the product correctly and use it correctly.

All these strategies of creating well-polished product documentation will essentially lead to higher rated products, more favorable reviews, and more sales are all tied to one other; therefore, it goes without saying that the increased sales as a result.

## How to create well-crafted product documentation

How to produce effective documentation and foster a culture where it is the standard? Writing effective documentation is challenging, and but there are many good features within [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)that can help seed up this process of making well crafted and dynamic product documentation portals. The following is a high-level summary of how we approach the issue.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yl3vJ0vYDWgB1AnFf/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/7b97f8c4-af64-8ddc-c06b-93e6f28fea96dayne_topkin_y5_mFlLMwJk_unsplash.jpg)

### Now lets get started:

**Page limitations ensure readability.** Writing a decent document shouldn’t be difficult to read and mentally process. Protracted, meandering phrases are frequently indicative of a lack of clarity. If the communication cannot be properly summarized on a single page, it is an indication that the product manager should probably go back and further break down the situation.

**Formatting improves the quality**. A poorly structured product documentation increases the likelihood that the writer will wing it. Create a template with well-formatted sections, tables, and document headers. It's a one-time investment with high dividend potential.

**Templates help you save time. **It's far easier to delete a section from a template than to remember to add one. It is not patronizing; rather, it is effective and time saving. Simple sections that remind the writer to begin with the broad background and to be specific about measurements or hazardous assumptions enable more precise writing and decision hierarchy.

**Comment and assign tasks** There is no surer way to demotivate your staff from producing high-quality documentation than by failing to remark on them. Comments do not need to be very smart; rather, they should indicate involvement and serve as a model. While it is ideal to provide feedback digitally so that others in the company may benefit asynchronously from the conversation, a simple feature in Docsie which allows you to comment and collaborate with your team works product documentation team great!

**https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/collaboration-to-create-well-polished-product-documentation/**

**Document types should be scalable to meet the demands of your company.** As more stakeholders get involved in the product development process, communication must be divided into several documents (particularly if the one-page 'conciseness' criteria is to be met). Docsie allows for a useful and sustainable solution for growing product documentation teams.

In this article I would like to jump into plugins that each Docsie knowledge portal and product documentation can add-on to their documentations to enhance them and improve their over all usability.

## Docsie plugins to make your Documentation portal dynamic!Docsie has a bunch of plugin you can use to make your documentation more appealing. In this blog I will divide it into 3 parts. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_4LttTJbkU67oXkSZX/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/898e185c-08b3-55da-e9c4-1031ad6792f5Snag_c3ee39d.png)

In this section we will divide the explanation of these knowledge portal plugins into three parts.

**PART 1: **The first part we will show what we will show what the 'Display Version Picker', 'Display Language Picker', the 'Display Section Anchors', and the 'Display Footer Navigation

**PART 2: **In this part we will show the 'Code Highlighting', 'Search', and the 'Share to Social Network' plugin

**PART 3: **In part three we will show the 'Image Preview, 'Document Metadata', and the 'Auto-highlight Section' plugin.



Before we jump into the plugins lets talk about how to access these plugins within the Docsie Platform.

First, within the workspace, we need to click onto the three dots at the top right corner and open our account: 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Mv9BSfFjt63Bq12ui/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/4ee73eb8-90f3-4588-7cad-537d6c3d2606Snag_fb448a0.png)

Then within Deployments we can access the Plugins once we create a new Deployment via 'Configure a new deployment+' 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_EyeRwNDqJuiL6yclc/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c3aa28de-aeff-0f8e-5b66-3e0f7cbdc564Snag_fb8dbd4.png)

Then click 'More options' which will allow you to add these plugins into your Deployed documentation via your an imbedded script or via the Docsie portal



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_3BNU4lygMNvB6VhgK/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/c16fe2e1-c05b-4574-1b90-5beb78b1ccceSnag_fb8f18f.png)

Once the user presses the Language within the language picker it will change their entire documentation that they are reading into that allotted language.

The Display Section anchor once activated allows your customer to have links next to each header which will give them links to certain sections of the documentation.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_yKD6jx7Sg0HdhzQ95/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/d5797b47-678b-f896-0387-9fb4ad7588e8image.png)

Every time these links are pressed, apart of the header will change and when your customer copies and pasts this html, it will direct the person they are sending it to, to this specific section of the documentation.

Next is 'Display Footer Navigation'

This plugin is great for technical products which need to express various codes to their customers. This plugin allows their customers to copy and paste the allotted code so that they can use it on their editor for ease of use by adding a ""Copy"" button.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_W2SjxQvvsp5Vut9t4/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/86322d6d-d84a-3e3d-80b2-33a74fef6d64image.png)

This highly speeds up the process in which your customers can find and retrieve their well needed information about your products.



Next is the Share To Social Networks plugin

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_0drhefPXvSjuyfjVF/boo_NbQ7i8LYu6f7q4rnn/382f6e99-41cc-698a-b66a-81ac9175b29cimage.png)

## 1. Pro Writing Aid

First, we have Pro Writing Aid. This is a grammar, spelling, and sentence structuring tool that helps writers create product documentation.

If your (oops!) unlikely to remember &quot;you&#39;re&quot; vs &quot;your&quot; when writing, this tool catches errors and provides contextual recommendations on the fly.

It can also provide a reading grade level (e.g. Grade 13), sentence variety monitoring (short sentences followed by long sentences), and passive voice (&quot;I will do the work&quot; vs &quot;The work will be done by me&quot;).

Grammar, spelling, and sentence structuring is more important than many people give credit. When a customer sees bad grammar, spelling mistakes, and paragraph-long sentences – it makes them lose confidence in your product. For example, a high reading grade level for a product targeted to kids is counterproductive. Passive voice tends to waste screen real estate and feels roundabout for readers, whereas active voice is short, sweet, to the point.

Add Pro Writing Aid to your Docsie workflow; improve your words, inspire your customers.


## 2. QuillBot

Paraphrasing is a common practice in content development, and this rings true when you create product documentation. Sadly, as much as we want to believe it, we weren&#39;t the first person to have that idea and put pen to paper!

Paraphrasing is as simple as saying the same thing with different words. QuillBot is an AI software tool that automatically paraphrases for you, avoiding plagiarism and its reputational or copyright-related consequences.

&quot;How would one go about paraphrasing?&quot;

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_cwSR1syhFEDnzXYY6/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/de4f4ee5-a94a-5f35-9b0f-3f6b482f1766QuillBotDocsieImage.png)

Just type your sentence, click &quot;Rephrase&quot;, and a paraphrased excerpt will appear on the right side. Neat, huh?

Consider giving QuillBot a try along with Docsie if you repurpose content on the internet. We always recommend being original, QuillBot is simply a tool that automates originality.


## 3. Snagit

Product documentation isn&#39;t just words… it needs images and artwork to illustrate the full picture (pun intended). By providing step-by-step instructions with accompanying images, users have greater certainty and confidence when following user product guides.

On Windows, the [Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b) is available. For Linux, [screenshots can be taken](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) using (Shift/Alt)+PrintScreen keyboard shortcuts. On macOS, [this is done](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) with Shift+Command+5. Functionality is limited, however.

Next on our list of software documentation tools is Snagit. It goes one step further as an all-in-one screen capture tool. Users can take entire display screenshots, windowed screenshots, or draw a screenshot capture zone. Snagit can also capture video and voice recordings, such as through a webcam. The best part is its editing functionality, enabling annotations like arrows and text in screenshots, or trimming and sound overlay for GIFs and video.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_SC6oDqX4HD1Py0agJ/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/46bf6408-a1ae-d79e-5924-8850700ee854SnagitDocsieExample.png)

Simply put, Snagit is a screenshot, video editing, and communications solution built for product documentation writers. Consider giving it a try the next time you need images for your Docsie Books!


## 4. Camtasia

From the makers of Snagit (is this a movie trailer?) – next we have Camtasia!

Camtasia is similar to Snagit, but focuses on screen recording and video editing. Users can take advantage of video templates with transitions and modern styles, and share templates with the team to streamline video creation workflows. The royalty-free Camtasia asset library adds visual flair without the copyright burden. Similar to Snagit, Camtasia supports annotations, device framing (full screen, windowed, draw an area), and dual-input audio recording (both microphone and system sound).

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_47zfmEreV6BA7FICb/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f1407819-11cb-74ad-0b1c-66fdd48ee401CamtasiaDocsieExample.png)

Camtasia on YouTube is so 2008, but it&#39;s not too late to start using this tool to create product documentation in Docsie. Give your docs some boom boom pow!


## 5. Tableau

Data truly makes the modern world go round! Raw data, however, is difficult to understand for humans. Computers deal with raw data all the time.

Tableau takes raw data and converts it into beautiful visualizations, making it easier for all audiences to see and interpret patterns, trends, and other data insights. It supports a wide range of database types including relational databases (RDBMS), non-relational databases (non-RDBMS) and object-oriented databases (OODBMS) – leading to virtually unlimited data visualization potential.

Here is an example Tableau visualization embedded in a Docsie Book.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_mgVz26JU76a3LADfX/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/8bee7e83-e25a-946d-bca9-08f5ad7588b4TableauforDocsieExample.png)

Test this visualization yourself! Open Docsie, create product documentation (a Book), and select the Embed button in Docsie Editor. From here, paste the embed code and resize to fit your webpage (vizElement.style.width and vizElement.style.height attributes)

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/boo_uyETYF3HNzbtX0KaY/3a781b86-b930-fce7-2bdf-4bfa373b4243add_image_toolbar.png)

Embed Code (paste me!)

<script src=""https://gist.github.com/PhilippeTrounev/ccd08606d97d114a5efb972473e9bb37.js""></script>
If your product documentation uses statistics and data, make it easier (and prettier) for users by using Tableau. Docsie supports Tableau embedding using iFrame technology, so give it a try!


## 6. Draw.io

An electrician never attempts to rewire and reroute electrical cables without a schematic or diagram. With that in mind, users can learn the ins and outs of your product faster when you provide diagrams and flow charts.

Product documentation writers can use Draw.io to create flowcharts and diagrams. This software documentation tool provides templates and hundreds of assets to build engaging, visually pleasing charts. For example, with computer systems and network topology, diagrams and flowcharts elucidate system hierarchy and the flow of data. Do the same for your products by elucidating underlying workflows and functionality

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_jo79eJ1rF0UIUwNSA/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e200dcc3-16f1-cd55-b228-1e5e90286f9fDrawioDocsieExample.png)

Draw.io is another tool that supports iFrame embedding. Create product documentation, then embed directly in your Docsie docs! Alternatively, you can take a screenshot with tools like Snagit, but we recommend iFrame as edits to the chart will propagate automatically.

## 7. Statista

Statistics increase the authority of documentation. To include statistics, try Statista when you next create product documentation for comparisons against competitors, to illustrate market conditions and how your products tackle it, or just to add some oomph!

Statista collects data across 170 industries in 150+ countries, making it one of the best digital sources of statistical data. All data is backed by peer-reviewed studies, and some data charts even show projections and forecasts.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_RUhjD6bkfd8IBFEKc/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/34ef079d-93ed-84f0-97fd-f3642905d6b8StatistaMainDocsieExample.png)

Statista is great as it supports iFrame embedding, allowing you to embed graphs and charts in your Docsie documentation. These graphs and charts update over time, ensuring your statistics remain evergreen!

Create a Statista account and try embedding statistics in your next Docsie Book!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_huVo7yXmIBx1LAGHf/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e97c9506-cfdb-ab1f-828b-114c97dd0003StatistaAltDocsieExample.png)

## 8. CodePen.io

Software product documentation is a different beast than physical products. It includes high-level technical information, code snippets, and dependencies – especially when catering to the developer or engineering crowd instead of layperson users.

A screenshot of JavaScript code offers little to developers and engineers reading your documentation, however. You can&#39;t Ctrl+C code if it&#39;s in an image! What they need is front-end code sandbox with build, test, and sharing functionality.

In a sea of software documentation tools, CodePen.io is particularly great for executing and illustrating sandboxed code.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_k5vSeT7kpOHl4UjHP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/804fb7d8-95fe-777e-ea16-3ebea86bdcbdCodepenDocsieExample.gif)

Code in CodePen executes in real-time on the page, showing exactly what your code does to users. This is great if your product supports custom code, as you can share a library of templated functionality for users to enjoy. Finally, the sandbox environment encourages experimentation, inspiring users to try new things and fully explore the limits of your product.

Embed code (paste me!)

<script src=""https://gist.github.com/PhilippeTrounev/4f4b59cdee9840abd42d95012c72655d.js""></script>


Try CodePen.io embedding in Docsie, and take advantage of our native code highlighting feature to help your developer users do more with your docs!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_vvYoRQeiL3LCUVDAS/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/66d06474-e719-fcc0-7823-994eb242ba28CodeHighlightingDocsieExample.png)

## 9. Doxygen

A lesser-known tool, but helpful for developers and software documentation writers. Doxygen (not related to Docsie!) automatically creates software documentation by scanning through code and identifying parameters, attributes, comments and more.

An extension for Doxygen is CLion, which enables you to view Doxygen documentation outputs in real-time in the code editing view.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_2cPEUGCErPeWsXEGC/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/f892b701-5578-e660-2045-67bacdad9bf8DoxygenCLIONDocsieExample.png)

Here is an example exploring the [iTunes COM Interface](http://www.joshkunz.com/iTunesControl/). Supply the source code, and the documentation writes itself!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_rtD8sCQOi1D4bB7jZ/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/9a57672a-6b0c-65c9-d40c-117b548f0ebbDoxgenOutputDocsieExample.png)

Try using Doxygen and copy the results into Docsie. Then, you can use our code highlighting plugin and other formatting options!

## 10. Pixlr E

We&#39;ve already explored how to capture images with Snagit. What&#39;s missing is a powerful way to edit images on desktop and mobile. Adobe Photoshop is powerful, but the hardware requirements and licensing costs limit its use to designers, artists, and creative professionals.

For simpler documentation purposes, consider Pixlr E. This is a web-based product documentation tool with much of Photoshop&#39;s functionality, but without the need for installation on a device.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_DDQflhicLbRwoBg51/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/c25d3546-c21e-994c-793c-9ae51a701733PixlrEDocsieExample.png)

You can add text, lasso and copy pixels, blur, fill with color (using hex values or RGB color wheels), crop, brush, pen, liquify, auto-heal, add or remove layers and much more! Edited images are saved in the cloud ready to be accessed or shared; all you need is a modern browser.

Give Pixlr E a try while taking screenshots! After, you can copy and paste exported images directly into Docsie!

## 11. JotForm

Docsie already has a feedback form for documentation – Docsie Vocally. This is only for reader feedback on Docsie Books, however, and not for general feedback.

Product documentation tools like JotForm allow you to create dynamic web forms and embed directly in Docsie Books. One example is for knowledge bases, where below each article you could include an IT Service Ticket form.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_PilAiIswkzAypwYPD/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/2712e505-5066-1206-005b-b41a3a907d28JotformDocsieExample.png)

Integration with ZenDesk means form responses can be automatically loaded into IT service desk ticketing software!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_B0XeGkP8hxM7CC5rP/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/49b6ff57-5a3d-0dbe-ab79-13d2d5e41545JotformtwoDocsieExample.png)

Try adding JotForms to your Docsie Books! Feedback forms are invaluable in pursuit of documentation excellence; you can&#39;t fix what you don&#39;t know!

As long as we have tools and software, we will require effective communication in order to effectively convey to others the use, creation, functionality, and architecture of our products. WHY? Simply because technical communication skills are necessary for capturing information and assisting the audience in gaining a better understanding of the product or technology we are selling.

While communication in the real world occurs through the use of words or expressions, technical communication occurs through the use of Technical Documentation in the virtual world!

Technical product documentation is created with the sole purpose of assisting the end user in comprehending the operation and architecture of the product or technology they are using. It's more of a detailed description of a product's nuts and bolts – a ""how-to-use"" manual for new employees, users, and anyone else who needs to know how it works!

However, as straightforward as it sounds, technical documentation can be perplexing! The majority of technical documents contain multiple phases, ranging from ""How to use: If you're new and have limited experience"" to ""How to troubleshoot: In the event of a bug or error""

Therefore, if you're unsure where to begin, here's a comprehensive guide that will assist you in answering the what, why, and how of technical documentation, while also simplifying the process!

### Let us begin!

You've come to the correct spot if you're new to product documentation and have never had to develop a product documentation specification.

While you may have mastered the fundamentals of creating a product documentation specification, putting it into action requires thinking and a committed approach. Here is a guide on what you need to know and how to develop a flexible and proper product documentation specification.

We'll define product requirements and discuss its purpose, as well as provide numerous instances of product standards. You'll learn what to include in your product documentation, how to write them, from establishing a product description to modifying them based on customer input and limited user testing, and how to get your products started on the road to production or the software development process.

## What Is the Purpose of Product Documentation Specifications?

To develop a product documentation specification, you must first have a good grasp of what the product is. A product documentation specification is a blueprint for the product documentation you're developing, detailing how it will appear to your customers, as well as its particular requirements and functionality of your product documentation, such as search capabilities, language changing abilities and many more. Additionally, it may include the persona or consumer for whom the product is being created but this mainly applies to products who are intended for certain age groups.

This product documentation specification should be extremely clear, easily accessible, and contain all of the information required by your design team and product team. Include as much detail as possible to ensure that your technical writing team understand what to write and your designing team understand the layout of your product documentation. A table or chart of written specifications will indicate where more information may be located. Bear in mind, however, that this is only the product documentation specification sheet - you may leave the specifics of detail oriented aspects of the product to be written within your product documentation to your team for later installments of work.

## What Information Should a Product Documentation Specification Contain?

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784881475-0e408bbca849?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHBsYW5uaW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyODE4OTkyNA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Each product specification is built around technical requirements, engineering specifications, and other product-specific information. However, the following should be included in your product documentation as a minimum:

**Summary: ** This is a high-level overview of the product. It begins with an overview of the product concept and concludes with a concise description of the product and its overall details. Additionally, it clarifies why the product was developed and its general purpose. The product description describes the finished product's appearance, and the features it will have.

**Functional Specs: **This is a written aspects that defines your product's look and capabilities. Additionally, it should describe how people will engage with it. Its very important to be as detailed as possible in these explanations, and leaving nothing out.

**Use case:** the product should state the use case of each function or feature of the product and how it benefits the end user. This could be deemed as more marketing level material. But if the usual has a user manual which also states the use case of each feature it will help them understand how it is to be used.

**User Personas: **This section describes the target audience for which this product has been developed. It details the target demographic and the problems that the product will address. Knowing the product's targeted audience ensures that your work remains customer-centric. Also if your product has certain dangers that are not meant for children it is wise to state that in your product documentation.

**Pictures/video: **each section should have necessary pictures or videos of your products in correlation with written information related to how the products is used. This will enhance your product documentation and the products use-cases.



## How to Plan, Write, and Deliver Effective Technical Documentation

![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450101499163-c8848c66ca85?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwzMTM3MXwwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHdyaXR0aW5nfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyODE5MDAwOQ&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=1080)

Technical documentation may get extremely sophisticated and complex! Thus, the critical thing is to ensure that your content remains current, accurate, and interesting for your audience by following these straightforward steps:



### Be explicit about what you want your reader to do when you finish:

Technical documentation is entirely focused on the reader's following action. Express your purpose for every step and stage of your product documentation so that the user understands what they will be able to accomplish after reading. If you are clear on the document's end-user guides, writing your portion will be easier. And the more extensive your documentation the easier it will be for your readers to navigate through the information. Docsie also has many tools that will help with this, for instance our [search navigation ](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/plugins-extensions/)feature allows your users to search through your documentation and find information quickly!



### Create an overview for the documentation:

Without a structured plan, it might be difficult to construct product documentation that flows well and is effective in reaching the main aim of your documentation criteria. As a result, it is strongly advised to start with a skeleton upon which your documentation can expand. Utilize headers, categories, sub-categories, and themes to properly arrange and group your materials. Docsie has many great  tools which allows you to create documentation quickly and effectively and it aims at creating dynamic product docs. 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_sxziwEXY4iYSB0p2i/boo_Qj6raZoQQmjvdRxVs/19e9557e-cdec-2c24-9ee1-b82dff8c70f4image.png)

We have search capabilities, a well grafted organization for your documentation, as well as many other powerful features.

### Define your target audience:

It is critical to understand the audience using your products in order to determine whether your documentation is directed at developers, employees, or users. This is to ensure that consumers understand the context, aims, and capabilities of the product or technology in order to assist you in adapting to your audience. And also if your audience is from a certain country outside the country of your headquarters then having [translated documentation](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-translating-technical-manuals-with-3-easy-steps/) is another factor you must consider.

### Include drawings and captions in your content:

Illustration or diagrams of a technical documentation must include various measurements which explain the dimension or aspects of your products. If you are demonstrating features of a digital SaaS product then having snippets of these features works wonders as long as you demonstrate what they do, and how they work.

Additionally, images help break up the monotony of words and provide interest to the paper. Captions can assist in putting product diagrams and drawings with clear directions into perspective.

### Reread, edit and rewrite:

Go over your technical documentation multiple times to ensure you haven't missed anything! Additionally, you may have your work edited by a coworker or supervisor to verify that you haven't missed anything. A review and modification mechanism would guarantee that the published material is accurate.

9/22/2021 10:13:37,Ciaran Sweet,"User guides are an important part of digital service delivery. Digital customers expect access to self-service, demanding immediate access to information. A walkthrough over the phone just doesn’t cut it anymore; hours of time spent explaining things that can be better illustrated in user documentation guides.

At Docsie, we advocate that all businesses create a library of informative user guides for customers. This will enable self-service, reduce your support workloads, and provide 24/7 real-time access to the information your customers need to enjoy and work within your product or service.

<h2>10 Top Tips for User Guides and Documentation in Docsie</h2>
Before we start, do you have a way to store, write and host documentation?

Head over to the [Docsie Onboarding](https://app.docsie.io/onboarding/) page for customer-centric collaboration, extensive embedding, tailored translations, and powerful publishing at your fingertips.

Now you’ve joined the club, let’s jump into our 10 top tips!

<h3>1 - Enrich Your User Guides With Media</h3>
Text, words, letters – we use them every day. Sadly, the written word cannot compare to the veracity of video or inspiration of images. 

When creating user documentation guides, read it from the user’s perspective. Could this section be better explained in a GIF, embedded video or annotated image? If so, add one!

You can add images, embed videos and integrate iFrame content in Docsie. Give it a try!

![Images, Videos and GIFs in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_CdhFEVXwXaefNXxxg/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/e0eda1c6-284a-3e0f-5c43-0ff4099966d0BlogGIF10TipsforUserGuides.gif)

<h3>2 - Create an Order, No Not the Jedi Kind!</h3>
Step-by-step instructions are the pillar of cook books everywhere! When following a recipe, do you mix up your eggs with your flour? That’s what you should do, and you know that because you follow the steps!

All jokes aside, ensure you run through any user guides with step-by-step instructions. If you follow those steps, do you actually get the result intended? Inaccurate instructions that do not achieve the intended result is a huge red flag for customers. Accurate instructions on the other hand instil trust, and provide value to customers and the business through information sharing.

Create an order using the numbered lists in Docsie, or with Docsie Book Articles to segment your documentation.
 
 ![Articles, Shelves and Workspaces in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_O4Ux6ERzhyIS0eB1X/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/aa925138-ab48-e18b-ff33-50557a2897cfArticlesShelvesWorkspacesinDocsie.png)

<h3>3 - Accommodate For All Reading Levels</h3>
Do you assume that customers will know their JavaScript from your top tips? Using jargon and complex terminology is typically recommended in the context of technical user guides. For laypersons, however, the simpler the language – the better!

Most readers just want to know how to do the thing, and repeat the thing. One approach is to deliver a complex, high-level concept on paper – then repeat again with a simplified version for laypersons. This caters to technical users and laypersons all at once, inking two pages with one pen.

“Artificial intelligence involves the algorithmic emulation of human intelligence in pursuit of productivity; artificial intelligence aims to get work done by matching human intelligence using computer code.” – they both mean the same thing, but target different audiences.

Use Docsie to create Shelves for laypersons, and Shelves for technical users. That way you can have Books to assist both audiences, with full hosting available through the Docsie Portal.
 
![Complex Code Simplified for Laypersons in Docsie Example](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_cnLx3DDYwihXopx74/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/411ea34c-096b-3bf2-fde0-2f8fdaddd55aLaypersonSimplificationforDocsie.png)

<h3>4 - Use Templates and Stop Staying Up Late!</h3>
Do you rewrite every user guide from scratch? Instead, you should create templates with basic structuring and brand messaging, and build around this content.

Writing from scratch takes time, effort and risks inconsistency if multiple writers are working within the same project. Templates are a great way to save time when writing, and drive greater consistency between pages. Trust is built on consistent messaging and value generation, which templates promote.

Click …More and select Templates in Docsie. Here, you can store templates and start new Books using the template as a source!

<h3>5 - Write Fast, Iterate Often</h3>
In Agile software development, the mantra is to fail fast and iterate often. Applying that to user documentation guides, your staff should aim to write fast and iterate often.

This doesn’t mean sacrificing quality for speed. Instead, this allows for customer feedback and responses with less initial effort. This feedback can be leveraged in further user documentation guide iterations, and helps the business to become more customer-centric.

Docsie Vocally elucidates reader feedback, with ratings and screen recordings to pinpoint the exact content they read. Give it a try as you write fast and iterate often!

![Docsie Vocally Feedback View](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_8uO5DnYSHSsLteI2X/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/b9f841c9-1dde-5eee-c723-809f13df3255DocsieVocallyLivePreview.png) 

<h3>6 - Nested Knowledge With Internal Backlinks</h3>
Is your user guide documentation backlinked with other pages? By adding links to relevant sections of documentation, you help readers to flesh out and understand your product or service on a conceptual level.

When you refer to a specific feature or function, always add a link. Allow the reader to quickly access that information, rather than forcing them to search and load the page by themselves. Talking about account logins? Add a login URL to the “log into your account” text on your page, and every other page. Make your documentation convenient and navigable within the body text, rather than an endless library to sift through.

Docsie allows user guide writers to create internal backlinks. Just highlight some text and click the 🖇️ button in the Docsie Editor toolbar. Additionally, you can make links language- and version-agnostic with Relative object links .

![Backlinking in Docsie With Object Reference Links](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_dclZdrsTWJrB8WETc/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/7d8c9e37-3aa6-580d-644b-0d7a8039fa89DocsieObjectLinksforBacklinking.png)

<h3>7 - Brush Off the Cobwebs and Refresh Old Content</h3>
Do you have old user guides and documentation visible online? If you have version 1.2 documentation published while your product is on version 1.3, your documentation is no longer relevant. Rather than publishing new documentation for each version, use Docsie Versioning.

Docsie Versioning allows users to access historic and present documentation versions. As new versions are released, old versions are archived for redundancy purposes while being accessible from a drop-down menu. This is all on the same web page, making it easier for users to browse and find relevant information.

Similarly, if your top tips guide for 2021 is still published in 2022, update it! Change the name, refresh any citations and sources with updated research, and double-check the information is still relevant. Brush off the cobwebs and keep things evergreen; content can always be repurposed.

 ![Version Picker to Find Older Content in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_OaCUumTVGz3CQ2ha2/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/4edbd225-b61b-0921-4f63-e55b3052ed28DocsieVersionsPickerMenu.png)

<h3>8 - Miniaturize Tasks, Complete in Batches</h3>
When writing, do you write the entire page in one go with zero pre-planning? Some of this boils down to personal preference for writers. By miniaturizing tasks, however, work can be completed faster and with more focus.

Create a simple structure with H1 and H2 tags and brief descriptions for each section. Use this when writing, and tackle individual sections rather than worrying about the whole page. This is referred to as an outline in the writing industry. The outline provides opportunity for feedback with editors before writing commences, and acts as a guiding framework as the writer writes.

Create a new Book in Docsie and add some basic headers and text for an outline. You can also add Tasks using the right-side menu, breaking work down into smaller batches as multiple team members collaborate on content. Version history means you can go back if a writer adds less-than-stellar content – perfect for writing fast and iterating often!

 ![Calendar for Task Assignees in Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_4JCx9FdXnyXu3quMX/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/d3468298-7bc2-7f51-7afe-2437f6321658TaskMiniaturizeCalendarDocsie.png)

<h3>9 - A Table of Contents for More Content Readers</h3>
With complex and diverse user guide documentation, a wall of text can be intimidating for readers. This can be resolved with a comprehensive Table of Contents. Commonly used in encyclopaedias, this helps users identify and jump-to relevant information, while providing structure to a knowledge portal environment.

Docsie Articles, Shelves and Workspaces work to create a Table of Contents. This will automatically show on the left-side of your knowledge portal – providing an easy way to navigate through your knowledge base. With this top tip, Docsie does it for you!

![Table of Contents Auto-Generated by Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_tovPs7rKnzB4cmaiR/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/file_oxDNcw0pA6rCZa3J7/boo_dqsfhc7ObadQ3xWmV/35d48662-895e-b83f-c7c3-abb0ce6edd0dTableofContentsDocsie.png)
 

<h3>10 - Master Your Subject</h3>
Is your writer a subject expert? Similarly, is your writer resourceful and good at researching topics they may be unfamiliar with? Ultimately, despite all of our tips, the writer dictates the quality of your user documentation guides.

The more they understand your product, the more accurate their work will be. Allow writers the flexibility to test and break your product, as users may encounter similar issues. Better yet, walk your writer through a product demo with your sales team, and give them hands-on experience with the sales pipeline and messaging contained within. This again drives consistency, while turning your writers into users. Not all writers become users, but all users can become good writers with hands-on knowledge.

### What Are Product Management Tools, How Do They Work and Why Do Product Managers Need Them?

Product management teams have a borage of life cycle processes which can be complex and cause many stages to complete them. These stages require product managers to use various applications to speed up certain processes. Product management tools are software applications that assist product teams with any or all aspects of the product lifecycle, including planning, researching, and creating, as well as releasing, assessing, and iterating on a product.** **Product managers also need tools for establishing a product roadmaping, user journey mapping, consumer research, feature prioritization, managing sprints, prototyping, evaluating product data, process mapping, and managing product releases are all tasks that product teams utilize product management tools for.

Remote product management teams who require a central location to create and manage their products may benefit from product management solutions. Powerful tools such as Docsie and Monday.com are essential to help speed up the process and allow for a smooth workflow.

### What type of product management software is necessary for a successful product management team?

Software that is meant to assist you in improving and maintaining a part of your organization must include specific characteristics. Because it's difficult to find a product management software with all of these capabilities, we believe it's important to include a various tools that are useful when managing your product. Let's have a look at some of the most important tools for product managers.

* **Product documentation: **In order to prepare your product for release, you'll need to create product documentation. Customers can use these papers to learn how to use the product and handle any issues. Every sort of product requires documentation, however, the degree of depth and types of documentation vary.

* **Data management/sharing**: In order to have effective coordination between yourself and your team members, you'll need a tool like this. A prerequisite for a simple product management cycle is the ability to communicate and interact with readily available data.

* **Customer survey tools: **There is no better method to optimize your products than consumers than to simply ask them how they feel about your product, other than watching user behavior**.**

* **Roadmapping**: The ability to use a road mapping tool within your chosen product management software will be quite helpful in ensuring that your product runs smoothly.

* **Prototyping**: To get off to a good start, you need to have the appropriate vision for your product from the beginning.

* **Task management:** Assigning the appropriate job to the right team member provides the best possible execution of that task, and the ability to monitor that performance in real-time is an extra benefit that many product managers enjoy.

Every product and project management team requires key individuals to create and manage various technical documentation projects. This is important for various aspects of building and developing products and projects as well as releasing them and educating customers and employees about different aspects of products, features, and their roles.

Although technical documentation may appear difficult, it does not have to be. In this article, we will teach you all you need to know about it so that you can get started on creating and maintaining amazing technical documentation for your products and projects.

### What is technical writing?

Technical documentation exists in a variety of forms and formats, although it is now mostly available online. Despite the fact that technical documentation is often created by technical writers, development teams, project managers, developers, and other industry professionals, the finest technical documentation communicates information simply and clearly enough for everyone to comprehend. Otherwise, it falls short of its intended function.

Technical documentation refers to documents that detail a product's characteristics and functions. It is most frequently developed in the software development industry by development and product teams and may be used to address the support needs of various stakeholders within an organization.

They provide context for items related to the product. Whether they describe a product's usage, technique, functions, features, or development, the end objective is to educate the reader about a particular element of the product. This is true regardless of whether they are utilized in software development, product development, or other areas.

### Who is the intended audience for technical documentation?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_gwW0HhhGm84k7Ee0A/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/0c71d6f4-58ef-a35c-75b5-03d70464afc6melanie_deziel_fSWQPBxqClg_unsplash_(1).jpg)

Audiences may be defined in a variety of ways, ranging from end-users to programmers to stakeholders. It varies considerably depending on the type of material in question.

Nonetheless, process-based technical documentation is frequently produced with an eye toward other audiences. They might be developers, stakeholders, clients, or other members of the internal team. Although this type of documentation is less frequently utilized than product-based documentation, its purpose is to offer a more in-depth look at the various technical elements that comprise a product.

At the end of the day, technical documentation is often created for the benefit of the product's users. Its primary objective is often to assist users in accomplishing certain tasks with a product, and so end-users should always be considered while producing the different types of technical documentation.

### What is the significance of technical documentation?

There are several reasons for the importance of technical documentation. However, it all boils down to one critical advantage. The main reason for technical documentation creation is to inform the public about a product.

This assertion may seem self-evident, but let's go a little further. After all, a product is completely useless if consumers lack sufficient knowledge about it. A lack of information results in individuals being unable to utilize a product properly or lacking the necessary expertise to really comprehend it.

Technical documentation is critical from the end user's perspective since it enables them to utilize a product efficiently. This is doubly advantageous for the firm that produces the technical documentation since it reduces customer care hours and results in happy users who can troubleshoot and answer their own queries.

Internally, technical documentation is critical because it provides employees with the knowledge they need to work efficiently on a product, whether it's highly technical material or a high-level overview of planning and processes.

In any case, products are not always self-explanatory. That is why we require technical documentation to provide us with all of the information we require about them.

## What are the different types of technical documentation out there?

Technical documentation comes in a variety of forms. The simplest method to distinguish between various forms of technical documentation is to determine for whom they are written. They may be broadly classified into two types: product documentation and process documentation.

In any case, products are not always self-explanatory. That is why we require technical documentation to provide us with all of the information we require about them.



### Process oriented documentation

Simply put, process oriented documentation details the method by which a product is developed. It is not concerned with the final result, but with the various processes, data, and events that contribute to its advancement and evolution.

This type of technical writing is typically kept internal and is of little value or interest to consumers or end users (save for external stakeholders having a vested interest in a product's development). It is beneficial since it denotes the many stages of a product's lifespan. This type of documentation is used for product management and project management teams as well as other corporate teams which need to initiate various processes and catalog documentation, such as HR and even development teams.

Process-oriented documentation can consist6 of Project proposals, which present objectives and timelines related to product development. Product requirements, which are compelling documents that describe essential facts and figures about a new product or service. Goals, user personas & stories, release details, roadmaps, wireframes & design details, risks & dependencies are common aspects.

Process oriented documentation can also consist of project plans, outlines, summaries, and charters.

Project and product managers have an especially strong need for product and project roadmaps, so having documentation and plans to support this aspect of their workflow is essential for the progression of projects and the development of products.

Project reporting and updates, as well as specifications of certain stages of processes within the product or project development, is another aspect of process-oriented documentation. This provides fantastic overviews of the many phases in your product's lifespan.

### Product oriented Documentation

The next type of technical documentation is product-based documentation. Often known as user documentation, describes what a completed product is and how to use it. Rather than describing the development process, it emphasizes the finished result.

There are various different types of product oriented documentation, however, the main key types are user manuals, tutorials, installation guidelines, troubleshooting guides, Frequently Asked Questions, knowledge bases, wikis, and other learning resources: These types of documentation provide information about your product and help end users learn how to use it.

User experience documentation is another form of product oriented docs for SaaS companies. UX Documentation describes your product's user experience (UX). A list of all pertinent screenshots and user personas. his includes user personas, use cases, style guidelines, mock-ups, prototypes, wireframes, and any necessary screenshots.

The next sort of product documentation is release notes. This may be used for internal documentation to keep sales and marketing informed about SaaS product upgrades or to inform users and customers of new features and updates to a technical product.

### Software Oriented Documentation

Whether you're writing for users or developers, make sure your documentation is thorough and answers their queries. You'll save time answering the same questions over.

Software documentation includes; API documentation software architecture design, documentation, and source code documentation. These documentations are very important for software teams to know how to build and structure certain technical platforms and products.  For developers it is essential to create documentation for software requirements, system documentation, code documentation, test plans and create other forms of documentation to increase and maintain effective teams.

## What are the advantages of superb technical documentation?

Excellent technical documentation is important to the product development process for several reasons. Above all, it helps everyone realize their goals.

What do we mean? If you're creating a product, your ultimate aim is for people to enjoy using it. As a consumer, your objective is to use a product successfully to solve a problem or offer a service. This is impossible if consumers don't comprehend or use a product.

Great technical documentation helps here. It equips consumers with product knowledge and helps them utilize it successfully, while also assisting product teams in their development process.

In order to ensure your technical documentation is well written the trick is to set up a proper process, workflow, and strategy to write quality technical documentation that is clear and decisively written. It must be simple to use and comprehend for its users. Otherwise, it won't assist everyone to accomplish their goals.

## What is the best way to develop technical documentation?

Many individuals are unsure where to begin when producing technical documentation. Not to worry; creating excellent technical documentation is a learned talent. To assist you in the meanwhile, we've broken down some straightforward methods for quickly producing good technical documentation.

### 1. Conduct research

Let's face it: it's difficult to generate good technical documentation unless you're completely clear about the material you're attempting to provide. If you already have examples, research, samples, and other data to work with, move on to step two.

However, if you're beginning from scratch, it's critical that you conduct research. Meet with the team that will be responsible for the technical documentation in issue, discuss, and assign various research assignments to various team members.

For your research, it is a good idea to compile all the current information and documentation you have to work with.

The next step for your research is to consider what your technical documentation will be covering, your goals and objectives that you want to accomplish with your technical documentation.

Then the next step is to list what sort of specific software, tools and style guides in the development of your technical documentation. These tools can easily be managed with Docsie. In fact all of your research can be written and collaborated to complete within Docsie as well.

### 2. Technical documentation design

The substance of technical documentation is critical. Nonetheless, the appearance of your technical documentation is essential as well. A well-organized, visually appealing document will communicate information far more effectively than a disorganized tangle of documents.

As such, there are a few points to consider while designing your documentation. To begin, consider structure and navigation. Individuals often utilize technical documentation to locate particular information or a solution to an issue, and they must do so promptly to ensure the resource's effectiveness. As a result, the organization of your documentation is highly essential for this reason.

It's a good idea to categorize and sub-categorize your knowledge so that it can be readily accessed. This can be done through Docsie’s articles within a Docsie Book. Articles will be displayed on the right hand side of every published documentation from Docsie:

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_iUtMpbO0NjOCAF31g/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/e8596395-59f7-8047-cc5e-74a54d5881c81.png)

It's also essential if your documentation includes a robust search feature and a dynamic table of contents that enables users to easily access the information they require. The most effective documentation software, such as Docsie, also has this functionality along with many others. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_IFCFzJGnWtVc2CzOv/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/eb564116-d7fa-ef24-1ddb-e5bcf7e3b4dd2.png)

Additionally, it's a good idea to start with a technical documentation skeleton. A skeleton layout of your technical documentation is easy to create and it will assist you in ensuring that you do not overlook any critical data that you wish to include in your technical documentation. We will discuss the skeleton of your technical documentation write-up on the step below. This will maintain the visual consistency and organization of all your material.

### 3. Writing structure

At this point in the process, it is time to begin the real content production. Meet with the team responsible for your company's technical documentation and assemble all of the research conducted in step one. Then, based on each team member's abilities, you may allocate writing jobs to them.

The highest technical documentation starts with a skeleton which is the outline of the documentation.

The documentation must also be easy to read and follow along and it a good idea to let others in your team review the documentation and comment on it. This can be done easily with Docsie’s commenting feature.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_BHCuBgK7PnFXEM5AF/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/b868c808-13f3-cd68-a5a9-e365ca42b1284.png)

Once everyone has completed a first draft of their technical documentation material, it is critical to review, evaluate, and review some more. It's a good idea to have at least two sets of eyes review each part of your documentation. This ensures that the material is not just clear, well-written, and grammatically accurate, but also effective for the intended audience.

If your technical documentation contains how-to instructions or steps to take, ensure that your team members test those steps and verify that they achieve what they are meant to.

### 4. Test how users interact with your documentation

You may believe that you validated your paperwork throughout the review process, but this is not the case. After you've completed your technical documentation, it's critical to run it through a testing process to ensure that it's free of organizational flaws, confusing content, and usability difficulties.

To achieve this stage, you should seek out external users to conduct a review of your documentation. Allow them to read it, utilize it to assist them in performing the duties assigned, and offer you their candid comments. It is critical that your testers are external since they will see your documentation objectively and without bias, which will impact their evaluation. This can all be done with Docsie’s web analytics. It allows you to see what your readers on focusing on in your documentation, receive feedback and also know what bothers them about the documentation and format of your technical docs.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_u6RAUGyvcgpYUsL7b/boo_uEOFXPlPg7tAhqPD1/4873aa1d-2007-2f3c-33d0-9c4b471fcae75.png)

On Docsie’s web analytics you can see a short video of how your readers are interacting with your technical documentation and use this information, paired with a rating done by the reader to optimize your documentation. It's very important to understand how to approach [customer feedback](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/) and integrate it into your technical documentation creation and workflow.

### 5. Optimize the technical documentation with feedback

Consider that you are now prepared to launch your brand-new technical documentation! After incorporating any feedback and comments gathered during the testing phase, you can update and republish your technical documentation for your users to use! This should give them a more wholesome documentation experience.

Nonetheless, your technical documentation journey does not end here. Technical documents are dynamic and are constantly updated and modified to reflect the products they cover. As such, it's a good idea to establish a protocol outlining what needs to be done when new information is added, changes are made, or general maintenance is performed.

Many companies choose to implement maintenance schedule updates to their documentation. They establish specific dates for evaluating whether any changes are necessary, ensuring that all their information is always current and that modifications are never overlooked.

Bloomfire may be a great choice for organizations looking to exchange research or thought-provoking content in order to produce manuals, user guides, or product documentation. However, some users think that Bloomfire's scalability is limited, owing in part to the lack of connections.

Bloomfire thoroughly indexes each word in each file, ensuring that users can quickly discover the information they're looking for. Bloomfire data encryption, safe hosting, and numerous backup sites are all included in the security features. To enhance interaction, Bloomfire has features for producing newsletters and custom lists. Employees and consumers also benefit from AI-driven searches with recommended content.

As a director of Docsie’s customer success team,  my team and I have come to a strong realization that quality customer success processes and experiences drive more referrals and overall enjoyment of a product. Through extensive research and experiments, we have found many cornerstones to a successful customer experience which we wanted to share with our readers who take an interest in supporting their own customer base.

Most people make snap decisions based on their emotional response to products. This means that customers always elicit feelings, and emotions as their primary driver to decision-making. While it may seem counterintuitive for companies to address emotions, make no mistake that your consumers are, at their core, human beings. [A Harvard professor](https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html#:~:text=Emotion%20is%20what%20really%20drives,are%20incapable%20of%20making%20decisions.) states that 95% of purchasing decisions are made in a subconscious and emotional level. 

Strong emotions such as wrath and irritation, as well as pleasant surprise and delight, are critical in determining whether customers will pick your product, engage with it, and remain loyal to your brand. There are a few key factors that dictate how your customers will respond to your product and your overall services.

### Why are companies struggling with maintaining a solid customer experience for their customers?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_rhcDyuT7eOO1d4tHZ/boo_m42aIexmkTiXjunWM/979cad02-6367-bf69-2a21-1c795bd963d9image.png)

Before we dive into key strategies to help improve your organization's customer experience we have to talk about what obstacles and issues most companies face and how it impacts the development of customer success strategies.

While most organizations report increasing their investment in Customer Experience, they frequently fail to deliver really great results efficiently and sustainably. Why? Because the operational methods that benefit the business in so many other ways are the primary impediments to the development of Customer Success teams and procedures. More precisely, the greatest obstacle is inherent in companies’ natural propensity to form distinct departments inside the firm. The split of functional departments ultimately results in the formation of organizational silos, a critical impediment to a long-term customer experience strategy.

By virtue of organizational silos, the firm purposefully divides and distributes ownership of all the elements necessary for continued success. Departmentalization provides several business benefits, the most significant of which is the capacity to apply much-needed focus and investment across multiple initiatives. However, it also establishes an inherent box within each department when it comes to creating processes and experiences in the context of the larger picture. Without a broader view, the danger of uncoordinated customer interactions and duplication of effort throughout the company increases.

**Lack of cross-functionality**

Another factor that must be addressed in this situation is the necessity for cross-functional collaboration within an organization. While most organizations acknowledge the importance and necessity of cross-functional collaboration, many fall short of establishing common leadership goals. Competing objectives reduce the probability that departments will receive the effort and resources necessary to deliver effectively cross-functionally. As a result, not only are each department's objectives not reached to their full potential, but they are also more inclined to blame the other for not assisting them in meeting their aims.

Uncoordinated suites of customer-facing technology platforms are one potentially important and unexpected consequence of silos, particularly for software firms. Adding digital touchpoints is the result of corporate functions not sharing supervision or goals. When a department is unable to get internal funding to address a specific problem or need, it will use its budget to seek funding externally. For instance, marketing almost certainly has its own website, while Customer Support almost certainly has a platform for storing assistance content and processing service requests. However, if you sell a technology-based product, buyers will not be able to tell the difference between these diverse experiences and the product itself. This puts all of your product management teamss' efforts toward creating exceptional user experiences at danger of falling short in the long run.

**Poorly written and designed product documentation**

Understanding your product is highly essential for explaining its uses to your customer. how many times in the past have you thought of a situation where you tried to figure out how to assemble a product with a user manual that was either, out of date, poorly written or in a different language which you did not understand. The frustration of poorly written and presented online documentation for many products causes a lot of grief and discomfort to companies' customers. It leads to them being frustrated and annoyed, and in most cases give up on the product altogether. this is why having an effective way to create, publish, maintain and update documentation is essential for any companies success with their customer experience of their product. Also, feedback is key as well, for once you know how the customer is using7 your documentation and where they are getting stuck you can make updates and optimize it to suit their needs and the wellbeing of your overall customer onboarding process.

**Lack of customer feedback protocols**

Lacking customer feedback takes a huge toll on the optimization of product documentation, customer support, and the way your organization functions to increase positive customer experiences. Having an inability to hear feedback is a great drawback to overall customer success and this needs to be addressed in order to optimize your entire customer onboarding process. Otherwise, customers may leave your product and you won't understand why or how to bring them back and keep them for good. this can hugely impact revenue and the reputation of your company as a whole.



## 5 Steps Product Managers Can Develop Exceptional Customer Experience

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_8aPOdtjILxNkucpSi/boo_m42aIexmkTiXjunWM/e264f18b-1252-d578-dd42-b146375f49e2image.png)

**Now that we have addressed the issues that cause companies obstacles in their customer's success, let us take a deep dive into what steps should be taken to create a healthy and productive customer experience by initiating key strategies.**

I am a big believer that the product management team inside a software organization is well-positioned to assist in catapulting a successful Customer Experience Strategy for their organizations. To begin, product management teams have a significant advantage due to the fact that their position is already cross-functional. By coordinating their efforts throughout the business, the team has crucial visibility into small shifts in focus and procedures that might jeopardize the customer experience. Additionally, the product management team is ideally positioned to improve the end-to-end experience, as user experience is currently (or should be) a key emphasis for their efforts. This unique viewpoint and experience-based supervision placed the product management team on the cutting edge of many types of transformations which will catapult the company to their success in user experience.

### Step 1:  Comprehend the client journey intimately through customer journey research.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_QiInNDMsqw4SPY7z4/boo_m42aIexmkTiXjunWM/e296fb17-1444-311e-f5b2-d1f780cec2adimage.png)

This step is highly vital and it requires you to do extensive research on your customers to find out, what they are feeling and how they are experiencing your current customer journey as well as what other journeys they have had and what they liked or disliked about them.

Conducting mixed methods research is the most effective approach for collecting data from and about your consumers in order to create an effective and informative customer journey map. When doing user research, make certain that you capture as much of their journey as possible––the step-by-step process that each individual user goes through during their day (or month/year) as they engage with a service or product.

As a general guideline, you should also attempt ""data triangulation."" This requires utilizing three (or more) data sources such as a survey, user interviews, and a workshop, in order to verify the validity of your conclusions.

### Step 2: Incorporating the customer journey research to heighten your understanding of your customers' requirements.

Knowledge from the research you have done above helps you gain a more profound understanding of your customer's requirements. These requirements are crucial for the long-term success of new products features and product upgrades. Share this information diligently with your employees, and use it to help you develop and launch new initiatives. 

Sharing context forces your team to explore parts of the experience they would have ignored otherwise and to ask critical questions outside the scope of the current product. For instance, at what point along the journey should the customer be aware of a specific new function be generated to ensure maximum adoption? How can the team collaborate with their colleagues in customer service to evaluate the potential impact of the feature on existing and future support offerings? It may also reveal more sophisticated details related to upselling and value-added features, such as how to design an experience that does not complicate or confuse clients over how they are invoiced for your product services.

### Step 3: Well structured customer service and support

Now that you have completed your search on your customer's journey you now have a better understanding of your customer's likes and dislikes about the process in which they want to purchase and use your product. Now it's important to establish strong customer support straight off the bat.

It is a universal fact that excellent customer service propels a business ahead, while poor service sets you back a few, or even many, steps from your intended outcome, whether that outcome is keeping new customers or improving the value of existing customers. Both existing and new consumers will remember their interactions—whether positive or negative—when it comes time to make their next purchase.

However, how can positive customer service encounters affect consumer behavior? [A research study](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value/) done by Zendek states that 87% of survey respondents report that their positive customer service experience influenced their future purchasing behavior, from recommending products or services to others (which equates to 67%) to purchasing or using additional products or services from that company (54 percent) to considering purchasing or using additional products or services from that company (which equates to 39%).



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_teSRsO8HfqSgFCDPQ/boo_m42aIexmkTiXjunWM/0507a12b-3f4a-e718-d384-c05fb01139d9image.png)
(The chart above has been created by Zendesk)

What is even more interesting is the research [Zendesk ](https://www.zendesk.com/)found from customers' behavior that occurs as a result of a negative customer service encounter. Almost everyone (which is 97%) of those who had a negative customer experience impacted their future purchasing choices. More precisely, 58% ceased purchasing from the business, 52% moved to another company for that product or service, 52% advised others not to purchase that product or service, and 48% were reluctant to consider the company for future purchases.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_ydgtE07E6Rp4AMmKv/file_Wg5BncrgbhAUFg4hO/boo_m42aIexmkTiXjunWM/da1e5861-6cf6-223b-031c-aab236256854image.png)
(The image above has been created by Zendesk)

This research shows us precisely how crucial customer service and support are to customers. Customers have a higher chance to drop off of the customer journey due to poorly developed and maintain customer service and support. By solidifying a solid customer support strategy you can prevent this use and maintain long-term loyal customers.

### Step 4: Clearly written and well-presented product documentation

With strong customer support comes great documentation responsibility! Good customer support in the background, plays an essential role in your customer's success however, it is also important to ensure your customers know how to successfully use and maintain the use of your product. This is done through video tutorials and effective user guides, knowledge bases, and product documentation which will be used in their education about your product. The user guides and user manuals need to be clear, distinctive, and decisively explain how your product works, what to be careful of and how to use every function of your product. This will make their learning curve a lot smoother and foster a good user experience.

**Creating good product documentation must include:**

* The ability to collaborate: assign tasks and comment, and allow all documentation work time stamped

* The ability to have searchable documentation.

* The ability to allow your customer to switch through different languages within your documentation

All of these and many more tools and features are found within [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/).

Once you have all these aspects of creating good documentation you can now write amazing technical documentation by following these steps I lay out in my previous blog: **Ho[w to create amazing technical documentation?**](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/how-to-write-amazing-technical-documentation/)

### Step 5: How to use customer feedback to maintain and optimize product documentation to enhance the customers understanding of your product

Customer feedback is critical in developing and improving aesthetically pleasing product documentation that your customers understand and use to assist them in using your SaaS or physical product.

Oftentimes, businesses are fearful of discovering what their consumers really think about their documentation, which creates a barrier in determining what their customers truly think about their product documentation. Without knowing what your customer is thinking about your product, product documentation, and customer service processes it is nearly impossible to optimize and improve your overall customer experience of using your product and integrating with your company.

**There are 6[ main reasons why customer feedback is essential t](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/7-golden-rules-to-successfully-approach-customer-feedback/)o know in order to improve your customer's experience.**

1. Customer input aids in the development of better products documentation.

2. Customer feedback aids in the evaluation of customer satisfaction levels.

3. Collecting customer feedback demonstrates that you care about what they have to say.

4. Customer feedback aids in the creation of the greatest possible customer experience.

5. Customer feedback aids in the retention of customers.

6. Customer feedback is a trustworthy source of data for other consumers.

Docsie provides our customers with an amazing tool that allows them to see what their customers are doing on their product documentation. This tool is called [Vocally](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/gather-feedback/), but it is found easily on our platform by pressing the “Web Analytics” tab.

## Conclusion

It is not the job of your product team to provide the functionality to customers; rather, it is to create an outstanding product experience that fosters loyalty, keeps customers engaged, and makes your product an easy sale to new customers. However, in today's world, that experience is seldom contained inside the product itself, but rather spans the scope of your company's many organizational silos, your product documentation, feedback generated by your customers and of course well rounded customers service and support. Developing a real interest in – and involvement in – the company's customer experience strategy is the surest path to producing a truly outstanding product with customers that love to use it.

Documentation is an integral part of the product development process. As the product moves from a proof of concept to a reality, explanatory documentation is essential for educating customers on how to use your product.

What are the first things a customer needs to know when choosing a product? What is it for, what does it do, and how do I do it? Let’s use Docsie as an example!
 
Docsie is a product documentation platform. It allows users to create, edit, annotate and publish documentation in an online knowledge portal. It’s as simple as logging in, creating a new Docsie Book, and typing your first piece of content!

Admittedly, we kept it simple. For product documentation, however, complex features and functions require more comprehensive explanations to drive the concept home.

In this article, we will explore 10 of Docsie teams’ favorite examples of amazing product documentation. Better yet? We will also show you how to make amazing product documentation of your own (inspired by our amazing examples!)

Let’s dive in! 🤿

## 10 Amazing Product Documentation Examples

Below, you will find 10 amazing product documentation examples selected by the Docsie team. We will explore how to replicate features and functions, and create similarly amazing documentation of your own in Docsie!

### 1 - Docker

Docker is a container virtualization platform that enables software hosting within tiny, modular and individually isolated IT environments. The concept allows for multiple disparate services to be hosted on a single host operating system by splitting and sharing operating system resources between containers.

>[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

![Docker Documentation Portal Homepage](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/oywtjgyzfpsynkqslptj ""Docker Documentation Portal Homepage"")

Docker has a clearly formatted product documentation portal, and presents all the essential information needed to download, install and get up and running with Docker containers. It also shares multi-lingual product documentation, API reference documentation, and a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section at the bottom. For the visual learners, there is also a video section in the bottom right.

To create a Getting Started section, let’s use Docsie as an example. To start in Docsie, you must create an account, confirm your email address, load the Docsie Workspace dashboard, create a new Shelf, create a new Book – that’s the basics done! Create a framework of header titles for each section, write instructions, add pictures and hyperlinks and you will end up with a similar structure to below!

The best part? Docsie does this for you auto-magically!

![Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ohzwitemzfuhcekepxex ""Example of Header Structure in Docker Documentation"")

>[See how this is done in Docsie, read the Docsie Quick Start guide!](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/quick-start/)

### 2 - Stripe

Stripe is an international payment processing platform with technical functionality that enables custom integrations and payment parameters using the Stripe command-line-interface (CLI). Its mission statement is to increase the GDP of the internet by building virtual economic infrastructure that streamlines eCommerce.

>[Read more about the Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

![Stripe CLI documentation page with code highlighting examples](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/zpxindusvnjuriyzpock ""Stripe CLI documentation page with code highlighting examples"")

This Stripe page is known as technical product documentation. It explores how to use a CLI to create Docker containers (hello again!) and communicate with Stripe using nothing but terminal commands. On the page you will see a Table of Contents, code blocks with copy-paste functionality, and in-text hyperlinks.

Docsie has code blocks, so let’s explore how to use them

>[Check out this Code Blocks Example in Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/plugins-extensions/add-code-highlighting/)

> Copy this code ready to follow our example - `console.log('Hello World');`

Open a Docsie Book in the Docsie Editor. The GIF below shows how to find the Code Block option in the toolbar, and contains a JavaScript example that prints “Hello World!”

![Animated GIF showing how to add code blocks to Docsie Books](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/dvofsbntefhpqxzetglx ""Animated GIF showing how to add code blocks to Docsie Books"")

In your Docsie Portal, code highlighting is applied to improve clarity for technical readers. Users can even copy the code with the handy clipboard icon!

![Live Docsie Portal rendering for code blocks example](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cgnoqwpldvdycrhyzqzr ""Live Docsie Portal rendering for code blocks example"")

>[See how to apply the Code Highlighting plugin in Docsie!](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/publish-documentation-portal/?doc=/plugins-extensions/add-code-highlighting/)

### 3 - Apple

The ubiquitous Apple! No, not the edible kind!

Apple offers some excellent product documentation for its popular iPhone line of smartphones. In our Apple product documentation example, we have a version picker, table of contents, text and headers, and finally in-line images.

![Apple iPhone Documentation Page](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/xvuspkjrqcaxcncgqzbq ""Apple iPhone Documentation Page"")

Let’s explore version control in Docsie!

>[Read our guide on managing versions in Docsie! ](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/managing-versions/)

When reading documentation in a Docsie knowledge portal, readers can select a version using the version picker plugin.

![Version picker in Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/vasmwlrjywxcrzbvjinl ""Version picker in Docsie Portal"")

This allows readers to view historical product documentation – you know, for those slow pokes at the back who haven’t updated yet!

To create a new version in Docsie, use the version management tab in Docsie Editor.

![Version selection menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cidsyyjlzvzipcoogjrn ""Version selection menu in Docsie Editor"")

From here, click Add version + .

![Add Version button in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/nvsbfjwaqyniyqlnagvl ""Add Version button in Docsie Editor"")

Next, choose a version number and version name before clicking the Add version button. It’s that easy! Update the new version document with any feature changes, and let your customers find the latest (or late-ish) information!

![Add Version context options menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ozelvlpwguxzksamascl ""Add Version context options menu in Docsie Editor"")

### 4 - Parse

Parse is an excellent full stack software platform that provides open-source frameworks for application backends. Simply, it offers pre-made code resources that developers can trust when integrating with any development project.

In the Parse documentation portal, there is a great documentation example in the form of compatibility tables. This monitors the compatibility of different architectures like Node.js and MongoDB with the Parse platform.

![Example version compatibility table on Parse website](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hkytunqwvoqlcsnwymgk ""Example version compatibility table on Parse website"")

Let’s make this in Docsie!

We can make a four column table similar to the Parse example using table blocks in Docsie.

![Docsie table block icon with four column option highlighted](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/jwmmuikvpbcagcqtkqky ""Docsie table block icon with four column option highlighted"")

Select the table block icon, then the four column option.

As you type, use the Enter key to move along the columns. Use Ctrl + B on the keyboard to make text bold. Finally, add emojis using the symbol option.

![Replicated four column table in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/awevjvzwxxxmspzcsesz ""Replicated four column table in Docsie Editor"")

![Symbol selection menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cunoxhrnzcfkcuncyqlq ""Symbol selection menu in Docsie Editor"")

![Emoji and symbol selection table for Symbol context menu in Docsie Editor](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/bbxeheaefvtzwkaeuavz ""Emoji and symbol selection table for Symbol context menu in Docsie Editor"")

>[Learn about the Docsie Editor toolbar.](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/)

This is an easy way to write API documentation and technical software documentation. You can go further by adding hyperlinks to the Node.js website, or internal links to relevant user guides. Deliver your next API compatibility table in Docsie!

### 5 - Flutter

Flutter is a UI toolkit created by Google to drive consistency in user interface design across mobile, web, desktop and embedded devices. It promotes fast UI design and development with an online code editor, and a layered container-based architecture allows for full customization.

Flutter hosts a range of videos for users to watch and learn about the platform. As the platform is made by Google, YouTube is the logical choice for our example!

![Flutter YouTube video examples on page](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/gdcgtpfnocqjnrjxmffb ""Flutter YouTube video examples on page"")

You can emulate this design in Docsie using video embed blocks!

![How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/aomjofizmdvjafyfpean ""How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

Simply click within your Docsie Book, select the video embed icon, then copy the YouTube URL into the text field. You can do the same with Dailymotion, Vimeo and a range of other video hosting websites.

We have a GIF showing this process so you can add your own videos into Docsie – give it a try!

>[Learn how to use the Docsie Editor toolbar.](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/)

### 6 - Ionic Framework

The Ionic Framework is an open-source UI toolkit for building performant desktop and mobile applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies.

It integrates with popular frameworks like Angular, React and Vue with various UI components, native device functions and theme support.

Ionic has a great mobile phone example embedded in its site. Let’s add a similar example to our Docsie Book using iFrame embeds!

First, copy the code below:

`<iframe loading=""lazy"" importance=""low"" src=""https://ionic-docs-demo.herokuapp.com/?ionic:mode=ios""></iframe>`

Next, click the code embed block in the Docsie Editor. Paste the iFrame embed code here, then click Save to continue. We have a GIF illustrating this process below.

![How to embed iFrame integrations in Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/vrigdonkwnbamjjpkfwu ""How to embed iFrame integrations in Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

>[See our official list of integrations using iFrame in Docsie!](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/docsie-integrations/content-embeds/)

### 7 - DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean is a cloud computing services platform that enables clients to host servers, virtual machines, databases and more. It offers dedicated Kubernetes services for scalable container applications, and managed solutions for web hosting, mobile apps, big data lakes and VPN services.

DigitalOcean offers feedback functionality on its docs to collect user feedback and iterate on content. Let’s explore how to do this in Docsie!

![DigitalOcean Docs page with feedback collection functionality example](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/qtyaynqicnsfojxakxtl ""DigitalOcean Docs page with feedback collection functionality example"")

Vocally is the equivalent feature for collecting feedback in Docsie. It allows users to leave a star rating, text feedback and even a video recording – sweet!

![How to access Docsie Vocally in the main Docsie Workspace menu](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/jobysqxbnhuglnpjbkoe ""How to access Docsie Vocally in the main Docsie Workspace menu"")

Here, you can access any submitted Docsie Vocally feedback. Users have the option of a 1-5 star rating, and a short text explanation. Some users may be willing to leave a screen recording, helping you pinpoint the exact problem!

![Live example of user feedback and video playback in Docsie Vocally dashboard](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/ktpgmveuafsztjjvigjx ""Live example of user feedback and video playback in Docsie Vocally dashboard"")

Every Docsie customer gets access to Vocally, and it’s invaluable in revealing the strengths and weaknesses in your documentation. You can’t always get it right the first time, but you can get it right-er with the next iteration when your writers use Docsie Vocally!

### 8 - Slack

Slack has arguably become the Whatsapp of the business world. The popular business instant messaging (IM) platform offers voice and video calls, image and GIF sharing, comment reply trees and more to organize and simplify business communications.

Slack offers tooltips throughout its documentation portal to highlight important information, and callout related features. Let’s replicate this in Docsie!

![Example of callout blocks in Slack documentation portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/rbxmfuwtimoecutilfjs ""Example of callout blocks in Slack documentation portal"")

We can make a tooltip like above using quote blocks in Docsie.

>[Learn how to use various Docsie Editor buttons.](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/adding-media/)

Simply navigate to the Docsie Editor toolbar and select the quote block icon. Here, you can choose info, warning or question block types. We illustrate this in the animated GIF below.

![How to add callout or quote blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/cientdcamlnfozadvsgw ""How to add callout or quote blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

Here are some variations using info, warning and question quote blocks in a live Docsie Portal. You can additionally use question and warning blocks to create question-and-answer statements – flex your creativity using quote blocks in your next Docsie Book!

![Live example of all three callout or quote block types in Docsie Portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/wrztunbzpesljcwarenw ""Live example of all three callout or quote block types in Docsie Portal"")

### 9 - Rust

Rust is a programming language designed with speed in mind. It can prevent segfaults and guarantees processor thread safety. Rust can be used to create REST-API frameworks, communicate with database solutions like PostgreSQL and much more.

The Rust Standard library contains in-line code snippets that work to simplify API documentation browsing. Let’s match it in Docsie!

![Example documentation in Rust portal with markup code](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/hpcrwxzsnkqkojtoemru ""Example documentation in Rust portal with markup code"")

The in-line code snippets include `Vec<T>` and `Option<T>` . We can do this in Docsie using the markup button.

![Markup toggle icon in Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/fgijgjarucvswdawsewg ""Markup toggle icon in Docsie Editor toolbar"")

To markup text as code, simply click-and-drag to highlight the text, then click the markup button. We have a GIF illustrating this process below.

![Animated GIF showing how to apply Markup to text in Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/diaerrmtfvogmuvqfylo ""Animated GIF showing how to apply Markup to text in Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

The markup text also contains hyperlinks. This link should redirect to a glossary of terms explaining what the code snippet does.

>[Take a crash-course on how to create hyperlinks in Docsie.](https://help.docsie.io/?doc=/using-docsie/docsie-editor/extended-formatting-options/)

### 10 - Yoast

Yoast is a search engine optimization (SEO) platform designed to help business optimize their WordPress sites, and improve knowledge on SEO best practices. The Yoast SEO plugin optimizes websites for better performance in Google search engine result pages (SERPS) to drive customer engagement.

Yoast offers step by step guides using list headers in its documentation portal. We can replicate this with list headers in Docsie!

![Example of step headers in Yoast documentation portal](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/okmupunyophvijddimng ""Example of step headers in Yoast documentation portal"")

To do this in Docsie, first create a Book and open the Docsie Editor.

Next, click in the text field and select the list header option in the Docsie Editor toolbar. We have a GIF below illustrating this process.

![Animated GIF showing how to add step headers to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/jyzdfkehfmaxtlegporx ""Animated GIF showing how to add step headers to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

List headers are part of the HTML specification. In Docsie, list headers are great as they allow you to create direct links within your documentation. This means when users click a link, they are taken straight to the list header (rather than having to scroll or swipe!)

![How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar](https://docsie-app-media.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7093/doc_GzKTESk1IUWjA77hg/lradwltxuqolxfmzxxwr ""How to add video embed blocks to Docsie Books using Docsie Editor toolbar"")

11/2/2021 13:01:10,Tal F.,"Establishing your  internal  wiki  is essential for many facets of your organization. In this  article, we will discuss how  wikis  are developed, their uses, and why they are important to your organization.

### What is an  internal wiki, and why do you need one for your business?

 
![What is an  internal wiki,](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_GJsWZd9629Xpu5d7k/ce5e5b39-8d07-cd5b-0eb6-4898b760dc86what_is_an_internal_wiki__and_why_do_you_need_one_for_your_business.png)

A company's  internal  wiki  is a dedicated location where  teams  may store, locate, and exchange vital  information  with each other. Consider it as your organization's long-term memory or internal  knowledge  repository.  Businesses  utilize  wikis  to record vital  information  for their  company  operations,  Information  such as corporate policies, procedures, processes, technical notes(release notes and other story descriptions), project plans, and training and onboarding documentation.

A  corporate  wiki  eliminates redundant queries and enables your staff to operate independently. Additionally, it safeguards your business against attrition -  wikis  save  information  that might otherwise be lost.

Additionally,  wikis  have a beneficial effect on organizational culture.  Employees  are compelled to improve their writing skills – to communicate their point simply and succinctly. By writing more clearly, you can think more clearly, which enhances teamwork and productivity.

## What are key features in a  wiki  creation platform that you should look for when choosing one to support your companies'  internal  wiki  needs?


  
![key features in a  wiki  creation platform](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_hk3Mzpy1tkqVzNgqc/3e2b47e6-eccc-39f6-00bc-df59744e852ekey_features_in_a_wiki_creation.png)
  

Your firm will tailor your  wiki  experience to your specific requirements. However, the following elements are critical to your  wiki  experience. When selecting an  internal  wiki  for your organization, ensure that it provides these characteristics.

### Your  wiki  should integrate seamlessly with the technologies that your  team  currently utilizes.

Your  team  already communicates and shares  information  using platforms such as Github Gist, Air table as well as  document  editors such as Google Sheets. As a consequence, your collective  knowledge  is dispersed throughout a small number of applications. Your staff must continually switch  tools  in order to have access to critical corporate  information.

While an  internal  wiki  may assist, the fact is that some of your team's vital  knowledge  will continue to reside inside the constraints of technologies other than your  wiki. This is why having a  wiki  creator that can integrate with your company's technologies is essential when choosing the right  wiki  for your organization.

### The search tool should be sturdy and effective.

A robust search tool (which is what we  use  at Docsie) enables  users  to quickly locate material without having to go through folders or topics.

At the very least, the  search functionality of the  company wiki  should be as quick and straightforward as Google's.

Docsie’s search allows our  users  to find  content  and  knowledge  quickly and efficiently. By typing in the word they are looking for, all of the articles and their locations will appear, which is one of the  best practices  to follow.

Consider the search feature in Docsie to help  users  find resources from  company knowledge. Docsie enables  teams  to centrally store, organize, and distribute vital  information  on  internal company wiki. They depend on our platform to assist them in quickly locating what they're searching for. That is why, when you click the search box in Docsie, we display your most recently read posts – since the  article  you're looking for is certainly one you've just visited.

Additionally, we provide faceted search, which helps you to refine your search. **For instance**, this is how you might locate references to the word '**Javascript**' inside your documentation and various articles:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955005-1700146955005.jpeg)

A quick and powerful search function is not only a means of reducing the time spent on the quest for  information. Additionally, it provides a great  user  experience for your  team, increasing their likelihood to utilize and adding excellent functionality to your Docsie  wiki. You can also set up  private  wiki  as well as decide who can have  access rights  to ensure the safety and security of your data and  knowledge management. For instance, you may not want to share access to  new hires  during their probation period, post which you can add them to your  team wiki  or continue limiting them to platforms like  Google Drive.

### The ability to collaborate

Internal  wikis  eliminate the  knowledge  silos that naturally exist in every organization with numerous  teams. However,  teams  should retain their own dedicated place for  company information  on your  wiki.

Teams  do this via the usage of books within shelves with Docsie (other wikis-type folders). Engineering  teams, for  example, have their own devoted subject for  important  information, as does Marketing. Additionally, each  team  in an  entire organization  may develop nested subtopics. For instance, each of your Brand and Growth  teams  may have its own dedicated subtopic inside the Marketing subject.

Whatever these specialized venues are named, they should make it simple to get the appropriate  information  in front of the right  people, at the right time.

Docsie allows for seamless collaboration with your  team. Here is a video that demonstates a few collaboration features within Docsie.

Here is an  example  of how we positioned the roles of our  users  within Docsie:

### A method for maintaining current and correct material

Certain  wikis  make determining if your material is up to date and correct challenging. Look for a  wiki  that prominently displays critical  information  such as the date and author of a post to find  new content.

Who last modified the  content  of your  wiki?

If you also have a  question  like how last modified your documentation, then having a platform that shows timestamps is key! Docsie allows all of our  users  to see what has been done within various books and this helps them understand what  work  is still required to be completed in  best way  possible.

  

## What are the key necessities for a well organized  internal  wiki  platform?

  
Creating an efficient  internal  wiki  platform requires careful consideration of several key factors. From effective organization to keeping the format easy to read, the success of such a platform hinges on its ability to serve as a centralized hub for  information. Let's delve into the essential components that contribute to a well-organized  internal  wiki  platform.

### Effective organization

To store and organize material,  document  editors make  use  of the conventional folder, also they can have articles and sub-articles, headings, and various layout configurations that can help to manage the layout of your  internal  wiki  a lot more efficiently. However, most of the time finding these files and knowing which file belongs to which department can be tedious without the proper organization of documentation. This makes it difficult for colleagues to locate and keep  information.

Having search capabilities within the platform allows for different  teams  and departmental associates to find the appropriate documentation quickly and effectively. Also having the  information  divided into books and shelves creates a more organized situation for the organization's  internal documentation.

Here is an  example  of Docsie's workspace. As you can see we have already organized our documentation within books and shelves. The books are articles and the shelves are a collection of different articles within a specifically tailored  knowledge  portal.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content-harmony-user-uploads/froala-uploads-1700146955256-1700146955256.jpeg)

### Keeping the format consistent and easy to read

Documentation should be simple and uncomplicated. With additional formatting choices available to your  team, the documentation experience becomes more onerous. When everyone is free to structure their posts whatever they like, the result is an uneven and perplexing  wiki  experience. If you have a simple to read format that is easy to follow, not only will it be easy to develop and maintain but it will be a quicker and more effective  process  in developing documentation within a simple structure that is the same design all across the board.

Here is an  example  of a  user  guide developed by Docsie. It is our help portal and it will help you understand what a useful and dynamic format looks like.

1.  **The main writing area:**  It’s a  good idea  to have images and diagrams, as well as the write-up to best, explain your documentation. It's in a nice location and sized well with headers and titles, positioned well.
2.  **Fully functional search navigation:** This is extremely important in order to speed up the  process  in which your readers find suitable  information
3.  **Links:**  Links are key to directing your readers to other  pages  that are necessary for them to review.
4.  **Table of  contents:**  This allows your readers to pinpoint specific articles within your  knowledge  portal and  internal documentation.
5.  **Language and version picker:**  The ability for your readers to change languages is crucial for  companies  that have a lot of  employees  that  work  overseas, within different countries.

### Search is not just a passing idea

When you have a limited amount of documentation written and a small number of  employees  it may not be problematic to find the right  information  quickly. However, as your  team  grows and more individuals contribute to your  internal  knowledge base, you'll become aware of these  document  editors' limits.

Most  internal documentation  is not meant for a growing  internal  wiki  with many  employees. To have a dynamic search engine along with a well-organized  wiki  is essential for maintaining a smooth workflow on finding useful  information, policies,  user  guides, and tutorials that the  employees  need while searching through the documentation.

## Self-hosting or cloud-based  wikis, which one is better for your organization?

Now let's talk about how to publish your documentation, is it better to have a self-hosted or cloud-based proprietary  wiki?

Let's begin by looking at the pros and cons for each alternative.

### Wiki  that is self-hosted

If you have the cash and resources, you may host your  corporate  wiki  on your intranet, server, or  [internet hosting provider](https://www.quicksprout.com/best-web-hosting/). Among the advantages of a self-hosted  wiki  are the following:

-   You are the only owner of your data.
-   You may design a  wiki  experience that is tailored to your individual requirements and specifications.

However, a self-hosted  wiki  consumes significant technical resources. Typically, it is best suited for  teams  with very specialized requirements.

### Wiki  hosted on the cloud

Docsie, **for  example**, enables you to create an  internal  wiki  without devoting significant technical resources. Within one business day, you can be up and running.

It will be easy to manage and  work  with. Also, it can easily be embedded within your  companies  website with one line of code, this will make it seamlessly merge with your company's brand's look and feel for an overall comfortable  user  experience. In a long term using Docsie to help you host your documentation through our portal or embedded Docsie  pages  on your  companies  site will save time and money in the long run, and lead to a more sufficient documentation workflow.

  

## Kinds of  Wiki

Wikis  come in different kinds, each customized to various purposes and needs. Here are a few ones:

1.  **Enterprise  Wiki:** Intended for  use  inside an association, these  wikis  center around coordinated effort and  information  dividing between workers. They frequently incorporate elements, for  example,  access control  and combination with other venture frameworks.
2.  **Public  Wiki****:** Open to the general population, these  wikis  permit anybody to see and alter  content. Wikipedia is a perfect representation of a  public  wiki  where clients overall add to an immense range of points.
3.  **Confidential  Wiki:** Limited to a particular gathering or association,  private  wikis  give a controlled climate to joint effort and data dividing between a characterized set of clients. They are frequently utilized for inner documentation and  information  the board.
4.  **Educational  Wiki:** Outfitted towards supporting educational exercises, these  wikis  are utilized in scholastic settings. They  work  with cooperative learning,  information  sharing, and class project coordination among understudies and teachers.
5.  **Project  Wiki:** Zeroed in on a particular venture or undertaking, these  wikis  act as a concentrated space for project documentation, task following, and joint effort among colleagues. They assist with smoothing out correspondence and guarantee that everybody in  question  is in total agreement.
6.  **Personal  Wiki:** Made for individual  use, individual  wikis  go about as a computerized scratch pad or  information  storehouse for individual data, thoughts, and notes. They can be a valuable device for putting together considerations and data.
7.  **Software Documentation  Wiki:** Frequently utilized by programming improvement groups, these  wikis  give a stage to reporting code, APIs, and improvement processes. They support joint effort among designers and assist with keeping a thorough record of programming related data.

## Laying the groundwork for your  information  architecture

The appearance of your  information  structure will be determined in large part by the  wiki  solution you pick.

In Docsie, the material is organized in three ways: shelves (which function similarly to folders) and books (which house the  content  itself). Thus, if your  team  makes  use  of Docsie, your  information  architecture  refers to the way your subjects are organized.

### As you organize your team's  internal  wiki:

Concentrate on clarity. Everyone on your  team, not just those who created it, should be able to simply explore your  wiki. Utilize many pairs of eyes to ensure that your  wiki  structure makes sense widely and that everyone understands where to get  information.

Allow  teams  to be flexible. Allow each  team  to create a subject or folder in the manner that makes the most sense for their workflow. A framework that works for one  team  may not  work  for another.

### Import and supplement  content

After you've established your architecture, you may begin adding material to your  internal  wiki. If you already have documentation (for  example, on DocX, Markdown PDF and/or JSON files), you should import it into your new  wiki  before it goes live. We make it simple to import material from a number of  tools, as well as markdown files into Docsie.

Additionally, you should include any significant new material into your  wiki  prior to its formal debut. Several items that  teams  commonly add when launching their  corporate  wiki  are their  employee  handbook and a tutorial on how to navigate their new  wiki  or  knowledge base.

**Configure integrations**

As indicated before, your  team  is likely to rely on a small number of technologies to hold critical data. Rather than replacing these  tools, we've discovered that integrating them with your  knowledge base  benefits  your  team  more.

Consider which material should be stored in your  wiki  and which should be linked to it. Certain types of material belong in a tool other than your  wiki. For instance, engineering  teams  that utilize GitHub may  use  Docsie to sync markdown files and include bugs and pull requests from GitHub. Thus,  users  may continue to  use  GitHub for their workflow while adding effortlessly to their company's  wiki.

**Internal  Wiki  Best Practices**

Navigating the  information  of an  internal  wiki  demands a set of  best practices  to ensure  users  can seamlessly access and utilize the wealth of  knowledge  stored within.

1.  **Intuitive Structure**: Construct a logical and intuitive hierarchy for  information. Group related topics together, and establish a clear taxonomy that aligns with the organization's structure.
    
2.  **Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search feature to empower  users  to quickly locate  specific information. A reliable search engine can significantly enhance the  user  experience and efficiency.
    
3.  **Regular Updates**: Focus on continuous improvement via regular updates as outdated  information  can lead to confusion.
    
4.  **Permission Controls**: Create proper access levels because you don't need to provide access to all  information  to everyone.  
      
      
5.   **Collaborative Editing**: Facilitate collaborative  content creation  and editing. Encourage  team members  to contribute their expertise, fostering a sense of ownership and ensuring that  information  remains up-to-date and accurate.  
    
6.  **Version Control**: Implement  version control  mechanisms to track changes made to documents. This not only provides a history of edits but also allows for easy rollbacks in case of errors or misinformation.
    
7.  **User  Training and Documentation**: Offer comprehensive training and documentation for  users. This ensures that everyone understands how to navigate the  internal  wiki  platform effectively and contributes to its success.
    

## Create a launch plan

You may now begin planning your launch. You'll need to make a critical decision: will the first rollout be limited to a  single  team  or will it span the whole organization?

  
![Create a launch plan](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_7YAL4VSGWRE1CfMOd/68851456-3d33-f0ba-ac37-0eb5d512ca53create_a_launch_plan.png)

**Team-specific:** If you want to open your  wiki  to a  single  team, that  team  will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the product and begin developing their own  information  architecture. Then, as your  internal  wiki  grows, the initial staff may give invaluable insight and assistance.

**Company-wide:** If you choose to deploy your  wiki  throughout your whole organization at once, ensure that everyone is aware of the procedure for managing your authorized  knowledge base. Otherwise, it is recommended that you begin with a  single  team  and then expand to departments and expand even further. For company-wide rollouts, we advocate hiring  team  ambassadors. They will develop into product specialists and will be able to lead the charge within their respective  teams.

## Final thoughts

  

Your organization's  internal  wiki  is more than a repository for vacation policy. Your  wiki  contributes to the development of a culture of writing and  information  sharing.

However, the  wiki  you select is significant. Choose a  wiki  that simplifies and streamlines documentation. Nobody should be required to jump through hoops in order to have a good grasp of the  knowledge  you are sharing. This is why we suggest that having a well-thought-out  internal  wiki  is a  great way  to  share information  in a strategic and methodological manner in order to help maintain strong  company  morale.",tal@docsie.io , https://cdn.docsie.io/user_profiles/15/logo_logo_QmXrbijvL0L2hFKNm6Q25DtjahujKdB6nu4pqBlLBgvtT.png,"How to pick, organize, and launch an internal wiki for your business.

## Why Documentation Is Important?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_PTc9VJ5wxwdL1k6yB/boo_EJBR2kCoLVuTRTFDl/ba1c9cc6-2f5a-b10e-9eae-74f8adcdf486ux_indonesia_pqzRfBhd9r0_unsplash.jpg)

To begin, why is proper documentation critical for a digital product development project?

The two primary explanations are as follows:

### 1. It serves as a repository for all significant choices.

When working on a complicated, long-term project, critical choices regarding priorities, features and strategic goals are made every day.

As time passes and the product development project progresses, it's easy to lose track of when and why critical choices were taken. It is critical to keep a detailed record of this so that you can quickly respond to inquiries and explain why certain choices were taken.

This is important to ensure that you achieve what you set out to build, more precisely that you met the project's criteria from the outset. Additionally, it is crucial for accountability monitoring.

### 2. It aids in the retention of product information.

Frequently, you'll have many teams working on a project, with little or no interaction between them, and in some cases, personnel turnover is fairly prevalent, and although an effective handover is critical, details are sometimes missed. Thus, documentation serves as a tangible record of all the information gained over the course of the project, both to ensure that nothing is lost and to facilitate the transfer of that knowledge.

And this is before we even consider the transmission of information to support teams and end-users after the product is out; which is another important role of effective documentation.

For these reasons, we need documentation in order to help support teams and maintain a good connection and collaboration between teams and departments so that the product can be released with everyone's assistance.

## How to bring a product concept to life?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_hEhWpISL2GzWXaggB/boo_EJBR2kCoLVuTRTFDl/afffdac6-e885-5a8c-deb1-2b69597a4147image.png)

To be a successful product manager, you must possess technical expertise, an in-depth understanding of your customers, and sufficient creativity and discipline to bring a fresh product concept to life.

However, the most valuable talent a product manager can learn is not related to programming or design; it is the ability to write effectively.

As a product manager, the primary constraint on your performance is your ability to communicate effectively with the rest of your team.

Your role is not to put out fires, control every facet of the creation of your product, or organize stand-up meetings. As *Ethan Hollinshead, the Senior Product Manager at Strava put it *“*The biggest product management challenge is resource alignment. Team sizes are always changing and frequently lopsided. Some weeks you have plenty of design bandwidth and no iOS, others you have no design and all iOS. Having a deep backlog of well prioritized projects is key to operating an efficient team*.” Since teams are always changing, having a  well structured documentation process and placement is essential to keep everything running well and effectively.

### Writing effective documentation is crucial in every major product area that a product manager is responsible for:

The process of writing out the ""why"" behind a project compels product managers to make difficult choices early on and provides the rest of the team with a clear North Star to focus their efforts on.

**Planning**: By breaking that vision down into concise, well-articulated stories, objectives, and sprints, projects become more manageable and remain aligned with client demands.

**Execution**: Product managers s that are adept at communicating in written form with designers, engineers, and others are the best at removing bottlenecks, resolving conflicts, and shepherding their ideas to fruition.

In general, the more effective you are at communicating your thoughts verbally as a product manager, the more accessible your thinking will be to others. This means spending less time and energy correcting or explaining yourself and more time focusing on important challenges.

## Product requirement documentation equates to a more comprehensive product vision.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_Atvu5TQEy94ODrVLp/boo_EJBR2kCoLVuTRTFDl/a370be08-a260-fa0b-ad1b-71c00091cd30ux_indonesia_w00FkE6e8zE_unsplash.jpg)

One of the most important documentation that product managers have to develop is called  PRD (product requirement documentation). When beginning a new project, a good product manager considers every element of the product and its surroundings. They ascertain the types of clients who would want the company's offering and why. They ascertain what other firms in an area are doing and how they may improve their performance. When they are uncertain about anything, they seek information and evaluate their hypotheses and preconceptions against that knowledge.

Great product managers utilize the information above to convey a narrative about the client and their demands, galvanizing the whole product team to work toward a common objective.

### A PRD's critical elements include the following:

* **Objective: **The objective part of a PRD describes the client issue you are attempting to solve and how it connects to your organization's vision, objectives, and ambitions. This outlines the overarching objective for what you're attempting to achieve and the intended audience for your product.

* **Release:** The issue at hand Outline what will be provided and when in the released portion of the PRD. This enables internal teams to organize their work by understanding the scope and timeframe of the release. Keep track of critical milestones and dependencies to ensure that everyone stays on track.

* **Features:** The next stage is to specify each feature (or user storey) included in the release. This portion of the PRD is where you describe precisely what needs to be created and how the development team should go about doing it.

* **User flow and design:** Include visual wireframes and mockups in your PRD to show what the feature will look like and where it fits on the overall sitemap or page. This helps the development team understand exactly what you are envisioning and how the functionality should be implemented.

* **Analytics: **It is critical to determine how you will evaluate the performance of your features upfront. Create a hypothesis about the influence that you believe a feature will have in order to determine if it delivers the intended outcomes.

* **Future work:** It may be beneficial to add high-level information about your product's future roadmap plans in the PRD. Include any pertinent facts that assist the team in comprehending how the product could change through time.

## User stories with a context ensure that client requirement is satisfied.

Bringing a product to life requires more than creating a strategy and then churning out features. As a product manager, your most valuable task is determining precisely what each feature needs to do for your client and then condensing it into the most concise form possible for your team.

While it may take longer to develop an impenetrable user narrative that puts your delivery team up for success—one that almost eliminates the possibility of their building the incorrect thing—you save considerably more time during the execution phase. Product managers that cut corners on this will save time in the near term but will pay the price afterwards.

The issue is that when you only state what your feature does it ignores the context of the consumer.

When you merely ask your delivery team to provide a list of features, you will always encounter discrepancies between your vision and their vision.

Prioritizing well-designed and written product documentation is essential for completing the onboarding process of your users so that they can know how to use your product most effectively. However, it should also include user stories to state examples of how to use your product and to what capacity as a real l life example based on user research.

## Written communication holds individuals responsible and keeps initiatives going forward.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_SkMdH7bHVaDRNaLa4/boo_EJBR2kCoLVuTRTFDl/f6ca1a85-e36d-0a54-bcf5-380ea9eec66fmarvin_meyer_SYTO3xs06fU_unsplash.jpg)

A poor product manager hoards information and must spend time justifying their actions to their staff. This kills product momentum—individuals spend their time conversing with the product manager rather than getting work done, and the product manager spends their time putting out fires rather than focusing on the important job.

A crucial component of any successful product managers work is ensuring that all members of their team have continual, unrestricted access to a wealth of information about the product they're building which include: FAQs, marketing material, style guidelines, customer interviews, market research, and presentations, to name a few. When your engineers, designers, and marketers all have clear deadlines and comprehensive access to the data and information necessary to fulfill their duties, your projects may go considerably more quickly.

When a product manager is fanatical about internal documentation and regularly updates it, he or she also holds the whole team responsible.

The product manager reports to the vice president or chief executive officer since their vision for the product and their opinions about how it should be performed are documented in public.

The engineering, design, and other team leaders are responsible since their team's contribution to the project is similarly defined in the vision. Everyone is aware of the criteria they and others are required to fulfill, which increases team understanding and keeps everyone on track.

Finally, as projects advance, new knowledge necessitates plan revisions. Whether it's a result of market research, customer interviews, or changing company objectives, being able to demonstrate the rationale for any PRD adjustments helps ensure that the team knows the ""why"" behind these changes.

A successful product manager's job is as much about updating the PRD as it is about generating it. As teams pose new questions, rivals adjust their strategies, and technological impediments arise, you must account for them in the PRD and guarantee that the ""living document"" does not fall behind reality. When a PRD falls behind schedule, team members cease to see it as authoritative and are less inclined to consult it the next time they have an issue.

## Writing documentation is the secret sauce of your product team.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_4z8D06QZclNxpCYTN/boo_EJBR2kCoLVuTRTFDl/369bc520-2e75-fd34-8a9e-0495da932f4aimage.png)

While all teams confront the issue of information management, product teams have a unique set of challenges when it comes to managing their collective knowledge of their mission.

Cohesiveness is critical to the survival of products. It is not about assembling widgets; it is about managing the delivery of a unified customer experience by several distinct divisions.

Writing in the extended form holds you accountable. It forces you to confront logical contradictions early and may reveal flaws that you were unaware of when just pondering things over in your thoughts. Additionally, it assists you in thinking coherently about who your consumer is and what they genuinely need from your product, rather than just compiling a list of things you believe should be included.

Writing down your goals and thoughts—and being thorough about what you say and how you say it—is the most effective lever you have as a product manager for ensuring that your product offers a coherent experience when it is complete.

Doesn't that seem self-evident? However, developing a truly customer-centric company strategy entails balancing many various elements, not only customer service. Customers are frequently overshadowed by more powerful stakeholder groups and other objectives.

According to one [study](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/customer-service-stats/  ) done by SalesForce, 80 percent of customers believe that the experience a company gives is just as significant as its products or services. As a result, it makes perfect sense to consider the things you offer from the clients' point of view.

Making sure your products and services deliver delight to clients at every point of their journey can help your business thrive and survive even in difficult times.

### Prioritizing Customers Needs

When launching a new concept, product, or system, ask yourself the following questions:

1. Who will this benefit?

2. How will it assist the individuals who will use it?

3.  What are the aims of the firm for this product or service?

You can develop something that people actually appreciate by asking – and answering – these questions.

Anticipating what items consumers will want and ensuring they have them will result in greater brand loyalty and customer retention.

But first, you must understand exactly what the buyer expects before you can offer it. It is critical to leverage essential consumer insights and then put them into action.

For example, if you learn that the majority of consumers prefer to get their purchases as soon as possible, you may utilize retail inventory management software to expedite the process.

Based on a[ study done by CapeGeminim](https://www.capgemini.com/news/8-in-10-consumers-willing-to-pay-more-for-a-better-customer-experience-as-big-business-falls/ ) states that 81% of consumers are eager to raise their spending with a company in exchange for a better experience!  This is why having companies focused on customer experience is highly beneficial for companies' overall growth and revenue.



### Examining the Data

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_q61tchvZNw2q7ev1K/boo_BstGrLgAjLTv3OCig/f5a88a5d-09ea-a4b0-e3fa-3a87cacd2c98john_schnobrich_FlPc9_VocJ4_unsplash.jpg)

You may believe you have a good understanding of what your consumers want, especially if you've been running a successful business for a long time.

However, here's a [sobering statistic generated by Growth Sandwich](https://www.growthsandwich.com/resources/what-is-customer-led-growth/) showing that while 80 percent of businesses feel they provide a superior customer experience, however, only  8% of customers agree! This demonstrates that you should not claim to be customer-focused if your products and services do not reflect it and it is a good idea to note that not everything a company does is considered customer-focused. Because of digital technology, there are more outlets for analyzing consumer behaviors and identifying critical insights – and [data compiled by SuperOffice ](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-statistics/ )show that insight-driven customer experiences help firms retain 89 percent of their customers.  You may create a complete picture of your target consumers and identify their requirements by combining data from customer surveys with qualitative and observational insights.

It's also a good idea to keep an eye on what your competitors are up to, as well as non-competitors, to gain a sense of best practices. You don't have to replicate their technique, but you may sift through the finest elements and combine them to create the ideal plan for you.

In certain circumstances, forming a collaboration with a rival might actually help the consumer journey. If you are unable to provide a product or service that your customers require, put your rivalry aside and collaborate with a firm that can!

### Making a Strategy

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_dgaWqcBvvxMjOsQwT/boo_BstGrLgAjLTv3OCig/050e1d83-c87b-3f79-bb68-bae24ca20f62kaleidico_26MJGnCM0Wc_unsplash.jpg)

After you've considered the improvements you could make, it's time to develop your plan of action. This framework should always put the client first, while also ensuring that any modifications are feasible within the context of your broader company strategy.

Product roadmaps may be used to promote alignment throughout the organization and are valuable in planning and development. Begin with the product vision statement, then outline your objectives and initiatives.

The customer-led product strategy must be embedded at all levels of your organization, so all workers must understand who the product is aimed at, what its unique selling features are, and what the long-term goal should be. Collaboration between your customer service and marketing divisions is a smart strategy to improve the customer experience.

It is critical to hire the proper individuals who sincerely believe in your vision, as well as to keep them informed and motivated. Using video conferencing software can assist in maintaining face-to-face communication with individuals in different company sectors.

Docsie has a ton of collaboration tools embedded right into its platform for easy collaboration. To learn more [click here](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/collaboration-to-create-well-polished-product-documentation/).

### Change Adaptation

Customers' behavior has shifted as a result of the digital world, with customers becoming more picky and impatient in the products and services they purchase.

They now have bigger expectations and more options than ever before, so if you don't satisfy their wants, they may move somewhere just as simply. While new technology makes it simpler to engage with clients, it also makes it easier for them to complain!

When compared to newer enterprises and start-ups led by millennials, older businesses, in particular, may struggle to adjust to the new pattern. However, it is really a question of ""adapt or perish."" Companies that continually find new methods to create and promote their products will be successful in the long run.

### Taking Advantage of Technology

According to an [estimate generated by eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com/public_media/docs/eMarketer_Roundup_Path_to_Purchase_Beyond_Retail_Vertical_2017_3.pdf), there will be over 230 million digital shoppers in the United States by 2021. The function of technology provides several chances to deliver an excellent customer experience and collect consumer information at all touchpoints.

Customer service automation is one such feature, and we're seeing firms use innovations like call recording services to make life easier for both consumers and employees.

Meanwhile, the emergence of artificial intelligence may provide further insights into the consumer experience through the use of intelligent chatbots and analytics.

Technology will continue to grow in significance, but you must ensure that it is always valuable to the client and aids rather than hinders their trip! The latest technology may not be the greatest choice for arranging appointments for older clients and more conventional organizations, where it offers advantages and problems.

### Personalization

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_CVmWzPHbpVv2IkjzD/boo_BstGrLgAjLTv3OCig/6ebf0dc5-feb6-6d23-780b-6082911cb2aaimage.png)

A customer-led product strategy entails studying which items consumers like and perceiving them as more than just transactions. However, simply providing consumers with good items and a pleasurable, hassle-free experience is insufficient.

Personalization is crucial because it helps clients feel like they are truly valued by the company. Finding methods to customize both the product and the whole process will increase customer retention – and a pleased customer will tell others about their positive experiences, increasing your rating on product review sites.

It should go without saying that you should provide an excellent omnichannel experience as a matter of course. Still, providing individualized assistance to clients while they explore and, ideally, make a purchase is beneficial. Customers like little features like adding more filters to restrict their browsing options and save time.

A customer-facing product roadmap may be used to keep specific consumers up to date on your progress and how you're integrating their comments, allowing you to establish a stronger connection.

By chatting to new service users and frequent visitors, you may inspire personnel to build empathy for the consumers. If a client has chosen to move to a competing firm, attempt to find out why – and see if there's a way to entice them back in.

### Keeping the Momentum

A customer-led product approach necessitates being proactive rather than reactive. Make sure to ask the appropriate questions before the consumer begins their experience, allowing you to maintain control of the process.

The onboarding system is critical in implementing your product plan after a consumer has been persuaded to establish an account. You might keep them coming back by sending targeted messaging or giving free trials or discounts on things you know they'll enjoy.

If you want consumers to pick you above your competition, the significance of website upkeep cannot be stressed. Ensure that your whole online presence is designed to provide the greatest possible experience for all visitors, regardless of device, including tailored product recommendations and lots of up-to-date, relevant information.

The ultimate goal is for delighted customers to keep returning, which means you won't have to spend as much money on marketing and sales operations - which is particularly good news for small firms.

11/19/2021 13:19:17,Tal F.,"![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_RQ70RIJrO72fVCVG6/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/1ae9ce23-353e-cb99-b922-ea4f722c7755image.png)

Prior to the development of a product and the subsequent manufacturing of that product, as well as the introduction of that product into the market, a certain kind of document is required that outlines the characteristics, benefits, and purpose of that particular product. A product requirements document (PRD) is a document or a handbook that provides all of the requirements for a product. PRD is an abbreviation that stands for a product requirements document. Typically, the process of requirements collecting is completed at the stakeholder gathering meeting.

A comprehensive set of requirements collecting papers, including Product requirements Documents, is collected at this phase of the project's development. To have a thorough understanding of PRD, we must first ask some basic questions, such as what is a PRD? What is the objective of putting up a product needs specification document? And what are the advantages of using it? The purpose of this page is to provide information about PRD and to clear up any confusion or queries that may have arisen.

## What Exactly Is a Product Requirements Document (PRD)?

**Simple definition:** A** product requirement document**, often known as a **PRD **document, is a document that describes the needs for a certain kind of product or set of products. The objective of the product, its features, its behavior, and the functioning of the product, as well as everything else required to launch a product effectively in the market, must all be included in the PRD. The product manager produces a PRD to communicate the need, the product concept to meet that need, how that product will be constructed, who will be the consumers, and the benefits that will accrue to the end-users as a result of using the product that has been developed and implemented. Public relations department management is a critical responsibility that must be completed correctly.

BRD and PRD are often mistaken for one another. **Business requirements document (BRD)** is an abbreviation for this. The goal of the business document is to avoid time and resources from being squandered on elements that do not contribute to the achievement of business objectives. BRDs are often prepared by a business analyst, business executive, product marketing manager, or even the product manager himself or herself, however, this is not always the case.

## PRD Parts And Components

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_LkoNhFQi5eseP6KRF/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/66b26911-909b-1255-2f50-82bf550c755bimage.png)

Using an example, we will show you how to construct a Product requirement document in this portion of the post, so pay attention! Although the form of PRD may alter from organization to organization, we will examine the fundamental structure of a PRD. A product release documentation (PRD) will comprise everything that has to be considered prior to the release of the product. It provides guidance throughout the release process and defines the prospective implementation of the product, which is almost always a software product in this case. The following are some of the most significant aspects to remember while writing product requirements and describing the PRD design, as well as the structure of a product requirements document.

The first item that should be included in the PRD file is the product's intended use. There are three crucial elements to consider while developing a product: the issue that the product will answer, the people who will use it, and the reason why the product is significant.

The second most crucial thing to do is to create realistic goals and objectives for the product that will be produced. This section of the requirement document discusses why a certain product will be launched and what consequences may be anticipated as a result of the product's implementation.

When you've finished talking about your aims and objectives, the next item you should talk about is the product's features. It is necessary to provide a description for each feature. The description of a specific feature must include just the information necessary for the reader to comprehend the feature being described.

It may be beneficial to include a virtual design of the product to demonstrate how the product will appear when it is finalized. This aids in the comprehension of the engineering behind the product as well as the manner in which the product's functionality will be realized.

The need for the system and environment is the next item to be added to the product requirements documentation. It refers to the sort of system or environment that a user would be required to have in order to utilize the product. The system and environment requirements may include the kind of browser to be used, the operating system to be used, the amount of memory and disc space to be used, the amount of processing detail to be used, and so on.

## Product Requirements Documentation Is Very Important

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_PZtuQYksgWdwZmj67/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/370eeff9-e3df-ee1f-6ca3-74110568ff4cimage.png)

The product requirement document (PRD) is critical in product marketing because it establishes a balance between the vision and the purpose of the product. It is critical to distinguish between the technical and commercial perspectives. The most crucial element that a PRD must mention is the product's intended use or function.

The PRD provides answers to questions such as what this product will alter in the lives of people or users, which issue it completely eliminates, and why people or users should use this product.

In addition to product characteristics, the second essential topic covered by PRD is the design of the product under development. It must clearly communicate the product's clear concept, as well as how the product should be used and who will be the product's intended users.

PRDs are often created for software development initiatives.

Product requirements documents also serve the aim of setting release criteria, which is now often referred to as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

It is written from the perspective of the customer or the user in a public relations document (PRD). Specifically, it outlines the product's motivation for being built, including why a user should use the product and what issue it will answer in their daily life.



## Procedures to Follow When Writing Product Requirements Document

[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) has a lot of robust tools that can help product managers write up PRD's quickly and efficiently. 

A PRD may be created by following a few simple steps in a queue. The following are the five factors to consider while writing a successful product requirements document:

### 1. Begin by clicking onto your workspace within Docsie

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_nJeL0kjIolsnrydQt/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/60c017d7-b080-0400-ea03-b3b0a63a74a0image.png)

Within your shelf create a new document by clicking Add Content and 'New Document'

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_lGytRmz5XZl8vez6J/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/87db9521-58cb-536f-accb-2e10eb8d8727image.png)

Note: By adding content, this will create a 'New Document' that will allow you to write your first Product Requirement Documentation.

### 2. Within your New Document, give it a title and press Add Book.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_WmG79H39qSNCPtMyh/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/4d20380e-fdde-f64a-e1f2-a62f0f4c47aeimage.png)

Note: By adding a book you are essentially creating the layout to your frist PRD documentation.

Click on tour book, and lets begin writing our PRD!.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_KvBhkH8gJlLFjAVEW/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/360a80d8-ed60-d276-215d-53a122a37ca5image.png)

### 3. Now that your documentation is open, click the Edit Documentation button and lets begin writing our PRD template!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_IfiOVg7e3YWOCWgbm/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/065470cf-0607-8a76-6ab7-9d4c37b094d8image.png)

### 4. Within the editor start writing a definition of the product, specifically its use case and functionality.

**In Docsie the editor shows us all the tools we can use to style and create our documentation.**



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_wdyfSyq5J2CFSy98H/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/46fdb3f2-016d-097e-31e4-24bb5bd59aceimage.png)

Within the editor start writing a definition of the product, specifically its use case and functionality.

You can easily add pictures and various components to your PRD documentation within Docsie, but make sure your descriptions of the features and functionality of your product are clear and decisive. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_7gIr7UykICGaXwF6N/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/e1cd1f71-12d5-4556-9fb7-2411131d7e33image.png)

### 5. Create a bullet point list of the goals and objectives that will be accomplished as a result of the product launch.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_6TLkJWnFRlZjrwVRw/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/2c7601e8-000b-edbe-2427-cf946baf2e92image.png)

### 6. Establish clear goals and objectives, as well as timetables for achieving them by creating a table within Docsie.

Write your product development goals and when you intend to make them based on research and then label them within Docsie's easy to use tables.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_A7XlgDeaLvqWco7zw/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/498e9630-c9c6-4d1e-ba89-15d181eabe2aimage.png)

### 7. Now that your PRD template is completed remember to fill it out and save all your work. 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_6I6ty0aFoj9KrTkJ2/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/62b14965-5cdb-94f9-605b-8378d4cf9cccimage.png)

### 8. Now it is time to publish your work, you can publish on Docsie's interactive web or through embedding this on your site. In this example, we will publish it on Docsie's interactive web portal.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_VWlyA4KZck0BMckjJ/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/29e81a70-945f-44b0-7dc2-07288e4dd26aimage.png)

### 9. Make certain to publish this documentation and password protect it so that the stakeholders get a chance to securely examine it at the conclusion.

In order to password protect our book, we should go back to the workspace and click on the three dots and then properties.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_IJzwWjokBsl54SLrw/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/28ee8e92-108d-3359-25b1-57d204d0108cimage.png)

Now we click 'More Options'



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_buI7LmESGCTFmyerQ/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/c013a6ff-fa0c-a5b3-42c9-eea02ee8299fimage.png)

Then enable password and update our book. 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_sg15rOoDxw8vNqQpN/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/1c2dde6c-c6e6-9fce-12d5-e1c43b4c09a0image.png)

Now we are ready to securely open our PRD template will be password protected with the password: PRD1. And since our documentation was published in step 8, all we need to do now is click on the link that takes us to the online portal.

### 10. View your PRD template document.

Since we password protected our documentation, of course, we will be required to fill in our password in order to view our PRD template. 



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_3PYkubCru3Qjs93wA/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/e22eaa59-dfd3-557c-9a9c-b14cca02c69eimage.png)

Once we have filled in the password now we can view our PRD template.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_l21bJALIlVY6bj5Wv/boo_oSV1aEcodrUrtwpg5/f01e08ac-48c8-f7cf-afe1-e78eec7d33edSnag_9cd88db.png)

Done! It looks nice and clean, and this is a perfect way to create your PRD. 

## Tuning the scope

When developing and launching a product, particularly a software product, the product requirements document outlines the needs that must be met in order for the product to be successful. It is created by a product manager in order to chart the route for the introduction of a certain product into the marketplace. Finally, it is authorized after the distribution of a preliminary design of the product to the stakeholders, and it is completed following the evaluations of the stakeholders.

## Final thoughts

11/30/2021 16:29:04,Tal F.,"Written communication is, without a doubt, a more cohesive method of exchanging information about a software product that every team member should be familiar with. This is the reason why product managers devote a significant amount of their time to updating documentation for any job involving software.

Understanding that producing various documentation for numerous procedures helps to keep the whole development process structured, preventing unforeseen difficulties caused by miscommunications, is widely accepted in all industries.

Let's take a look at some of the benefits of documentation for product managers to get a better understanding of how important it really is.

## What is the importance of documentation for product managers?

![Importance of documentation for product managers](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_XYQ5ntfsPFkJhvxSM/boo_tt3aeZp07xsCA9YkY/ddbbfc33-4cf1-a58f-090a-6b645b5f4034firmbee_com_gcsNOsPEXfs_unsplash.jpg)


### To Develop a Precise Product Vision

Documentation assists product managers in identifying the answers to all of the ""whys"" that arise in initiatives that revolve around the core product or service. Writing everything down helps product managers in making critical choices and receiving answers to queries such as who is the product created for, and why does the app or product needs to be developed from the beginning. This prevents any possibility of misunderstandings or blunders.

### A Significant Assist in the Planning Process

You can't just assume that your product is the greatest answer to the outlying problem; you have to have a strategy for it to be the best solution. Now, before anything else, preparation is essential. By clearly and concisely documenting their vision via the creation of stories, sprints, and objectives, managers enable the whole development team to produce software that is aligned with the demands of the consumers they serve.

### Supports Execution on Time

If plans are not carried out on time and in the proper way, they are rendered ineffective. To transform an app concept into a genuine and well-functioning application, a product manager employs documentation and written communication with designers, developers, and other stakeholders to push them in the right direction and execute the well-articulated plans that have been developed.

### Teams are held responsible

By maintaining complete documentation of all work associated with a given product, product managers may access a wealth of information about what team members are doing and hold them accountable for their part of the duties. Keeping detailed records of everything helps to keep things simple and straightforward.

### Customers' Needs Are Met

Product managers may readily access what features should be included in the application and what tasks each feature must fulfill by documenting everything from the app concept to the planning stage. Later on, they may communicate this evaluation to the team in a precise and understandable manner, ensuring that the final product is exactly what consumers want.



**Creating documentation is a key aspect of product management. The following is a list of 10 key documentations that product managers work with in order to maximize the productivity of their team and projects.**



1. Documentation pertaining to competitive analysis

2. Documentation Outlining the Product Strategy and Vision

3. Product Requirement Documentation (PRDs)

4. OKRs, key performance indicators, and success metrics

5. Roadmaps Documentation

6. Documentation pertaining to designs and prototypes

7. Documentation describing the user's journey and stories

8. Documentation describing the release notes and scope

9. Internal Guides and Frequently Asked Questions

10. Customer-Facing User Guides and Product Documentation

### Documentation pertaining to competitive analysis

Conducting competitive analysis research is a huge part of market research which allows you to investigate your product's competitive advantage over your competition who produce the same or similar product.

Competitive analysis includes investigating the goods and services offered by rivals, as well as their market share and strengths and weaknesses. Competitive analysis documentation, which includes all of the above-mentioned factors, is created and sent to the whole development team for review. A product manager will only make a final decision on the design of their application or product after doing comprehensive research on the competition.

The following is an example of how a competitor's table would appear in the competitive analysis documentation:

* The company's name is referred to as the competitor.

* The website address of the competitor

* The number of users, which is (to estimate the effectiveness of its products and services)

* The length of time that a rival has been in the market

* Competitors' specifics and areas of expertise

* The cost of a service or a product

* Notes on various topics

Because product managers do a variety of different sorts of analysis, the contents of the document might vary dramatically from one to the next. Capabilities analysis, Competitive landscape analysis, Competitive differentiation analysis, Imitability Ladder analysis, and Value Proposition analysis are some of the more well-known types.

### Documentation Outlining the Product Strategy and Vision

![Documentation Outlining the Product Strategy and Vision](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_fOcQeHgEHeuCjKOTU/boo_tt3aeZp07xsCA9YkY/115c02c0-2019-006e-ae69-acc57558cdd5patrick_perkins_ETRPjvb0KM0_unsplash_(1).jpg)

When it comes to product vision, it is something that creates a picture of the future of the product that we are attempting to develop. In the form of a storyboard, a narrative, or a prototype, it is intended to entice teams, investors, and partners to invest in and support the product in some way.

It is the sequence of goods that are intended to be generated until the ultimate product is attained that defines product strategy.

One of the most important abilities of effective product managers is the ability to develop a product vision, yet this is just the beginning. They must also build an enticing product strategy in order to convey a clear viewpoint on the product to the audience. Both the product vision and the product strategy must be highly purposeful in order for them to succeed. Consequently, documentations are prepared to capture all of the information connected to determining what the final product will be and how to bring a concept into reality. The majority of the time, these materials are shared with stakeholders in order to solicit their comments and their opinions.

### Product Requirement Documentation (PRDs)

**Product Requirement Documentation** are all-in-one documentation that brings together the many aspects of an application in a single location. Specs documentation is the most popular sort of document, and they provide a description of the applications' characteristics, among other things. They are also known as specification documents.

It is possible that each PRD will be different from the others. These documentations lay out the research issue statements, success metrics, MVP feature list, technical implementation details, and so on for the research project.

Product requirements documents (PRDs) include every step in the entire picture of the product, as well as the decision on whether to include or remove particular features, and they indicate any possible difficulties. Product managers may use this document to visualize the amount of time necessary for project development processes, comprehend the amount of money required for project development processes, and establish a mutually complete understanding between customers and the development team.

I have stated the importance of PRD’s in another article. [To learn more click here. ](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/product-requirements-documentation-for-product-managers/)

### Objectives and key results, key performance indicators, and success metrics documentation

![Objectives and key results, key performance indicators, and success metrics documentation](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_C5dij4zpuNJfYdxuZ/boo_tt3aeZp07xsCA9YkY/944a57c7-e03b-eb86-7f94-c5335ba726c3domenico_loia_hGV2TfOh0ns_unsplash.jpg)

**Objective** and **Key Results** is a mechanism used by product managers to determine the goals of a product development process and then access the outcomes of that process as it continues. The aim directs the team towards the goals, while the outcomes indicate whether or not the goals have been attained. Two questions are asked and answered throughout the process: ""Where do you wish to go?"" and ""Have you arrived or have you failed to arrive"" at a specific goal or product objective.

However, a key performance indicator, or KPI for short, measures the overall success of a development process at its current stage of development. Customer Lifetime Value and Trial-to-Customer Conversion Rate in sales, Web traffic and Conversion Rate in marketing, to name a few examples of key performance indicators (KPIs). All of these objectives, as well as the outcomes obtained throughout the process, are detailed in the relevant documentation.

### Roadmaps Documentation

Roadmaps are one of the most important documentation that product managers are supposed to formulate. A roadmap serves as a means of communicating to the team the significance of the product.

A product manager creates a product life cycle that outlines what needs to be done when it needs to be done and how the whole process will be carried out. A roadmap is a document that contains a list of all of the initiatives that have been undertaken in order to effectively build software or any other product. It is a route that product managers have laid out and that the whole team follows. These may be prepared on Docsie to submit to their employees with embedded PowerPoint presentations within the documentation created by Google Slides. Docsie allows integration with Google slides through our integration capabilities.

### Documentation pertaining to designs and prototypes

![Documentation pertaining to designs and prototypes](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_7UkZbKPYCrKwI0wls/boo_tt3aeZp07xsCA9YkY/dbf4c782-cb7c-467a-3fbb-eaf18de2c57bedho_pratama_T6fDN60bMWY_unsplash.jpg)

Creating something from scratch without a blueprint is quite difficult. This is also true in the case of product design. Although the basic concept is important, there are hundreds of variants that might occur during the development process. As a result, product managers must maintain a document that has a record of all of the modifications and revisions that have been made to the product's design.

When it comes to product prototyping, product managers have a very different experience than engineers or designers. Product managers set the tone for prototyping by setting clear goals and laying out a roadmap for the team to follow.

If you are wondering why a product manager would need to produce an app prototype documentation, then consider the following benefits of doing so:

* The potential of misunderstanding is completely eliminated.

* Iterations are completed quickly

* Early in the process, it is important to provide justification for the notions

* Improvements in the quality of technical feedback

For this reason and more prototyping documentation is essential.

### Documentation describing the user's journey and stories

In the development of any application or platform, **user stories** and **customer journey** maps are two critical tools that must be used in conjunction with one another. Product managers develop and maintain documentation for these two positions in order to ensure that every detail is recorded and kept safe and secure.

When creating a user narrative document, it is important to think about the many reasons why a user would want to utilize a certain product. Product managers record every conceivable trigger that might lead to a user interacting with a feature of the platform, including bugs and feature requests. A user journey might be considered on a microscopic level in this case.

In contrast, the user journey is a document that maps out the whole user experience, from the point of purchase or download to the point of usage of the product's features. This assists product managers in further explaining the product to their team and other interested parties (stakeholders, for example), as well as in establishing their confidence in the product itself. Also, this information can be used as marketing resources for ad campaigns or to explain the use case of a product to potential clients.

### Documentation describing the release notes and scope

**Release Notes**, as the name implies, are the documentations that are sent in conjunction with the release of new platforms or SaaS products. In order to notify users about new standards, identify which issues have been solved, and market the application when the update is complete, product managers put together this documentation. Because SaaS products differ widely from one another, no two documentation are exactly the same.

Scope notes are sometimes referred to as Scope of work documents in certain circles. Managers use this tool to define the breadth of the features that an application or a piece of software contains. What those characteristics will make possible, and so forth.

### Internal Guides and Frequently Asked Questions

It is necessary to produce confidential internal **FAQs **for stakeholders in order to keep them informed throughout the whole product development process. The way in which these FAQs are written is really straightforward. The wireframes of a product with a strong user experience component, or a link to divide wireframe documentation, may be found in this folder.

All of the information about how things function in the development process is included inside these internal manuals. In addition to ensuring that data is recorded in such a way as to permit smooth hand-off among members, it also serves as a reference for external-facing jobs such as sales, marketing, customer support, and other similar positions to help customers.

### Customer-Facing User Guides and Product Documentation

![Customer-Facing User Guides and Product Documentation](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_vQfR1TFvrUMWGTXFc/file_QaQUnhXAgdAoDoEVV/boo_tt3aeZp07xsCA9YkY/a9b5abb3-dc46-6359-9f21-cb8c8319a976mantas_hesthaven__g1WdcKcV3w_unsplash.jpg)

For the uninitiated, the customer-facing guide is a user manual document in the traditional sense. It is the responsibility of product managers to prepare this documentation, which will provide instructions on how to utilize the newly built SaaS product.

Users may find themselves in a state of confusion as to how to run the product if this is not done, at least in the beginning stages, until they figure out the flow on their own. Consequently, it should be quite obvious why this document is so significant that it is one of the most often used or developed documentation by product managers in the industry.

## Conclusions:

Briefly stated, the following documentations are the top ten documents that competent product managers rely on in order to ensure an efficient product management process is followed.

Due to these documentations, it is impossible for them to have any misunderstandings or disputes since they have separated the information about the duties into several papers. It produces a highly structured and seamless development process that has been meticulously documented at every stage.

12/17/2021 8:47:45,Tal F.,"In order to understand how to create a product one-pager that people will really read, it's vital to first understand what it is intended to do. The product one-pager is a stage that occurs between the conception of an idea and the creation of full project blueprints. Despite its briefness, it is far from being a scribbled-on-the-paper thinking experiment. It is a well-researched document that sets the tone for a product or important feature early in the product's lifetime by establishing expectations.

One-page product descriptions that are captivating may help to develop support and momentum for the campaign. It may serve as a reference point even after the focus has switched to development, user experience, and quality assurance. It may also put a stop to a fresh endeavor.

So, what is it about a one-pager that makes it so special? Let's start with a discussion of why you would need one of them in the first place.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_PxyDYGHjeyG9ksVIF/file_ysSFwqghldoCqMbsM/d1045970-c6ae-4605-3ba2-379bb5ab92d0scott_graham_5fNmWej4tAA_unsplash_min.jpg)

## Three Arguments for Writing a Product One-Pager

Why has this specific analog relic remained relevant and valuable in an age where so many papers have been replaced by collaborative digital means for communication, as opposed to earlier generations?

The task of establishing a shared understanding of fundamental facts and ideas has gotten increasingly difficult in recent years. A well-constructed product one-pager documentation may bridge gaps and develop support by setting the stage for stakeholders and providing them with information.

This one-pager can be totally digitally created and formatted in order to email to others and even converted into a PDF with Docsie, but why is this one-pager so important for product managers?

### 1. Raise awareness and support for a certain issue.

A product one-pager argues for the importance of a new initiative and why the company should support it. It highlights the fundamental goals of the projects and discusses how their success will benefit the company as a whole if they are successful.

To inspire confidence in the decision-maker, it gives information regarding the opportunity and competitive situation. By putting out the essentials, there is enough knowledge and mutual comprehension to go ahead in a productive manner.

### 2. Define the scope of the project.

Many stakeholders are apprehensive about embarking on a new endeavor without fully understanding what it involves. A one-pager outlines what is included in the initiatives, as well as what is not included, which is critical information.

Decision-makers get more confidence in what they're supporting when these important aspects are clearly articulated. It serves as a constant reference point throughout the project's lifespan, defining criteria for what should be included and excluded.

### 3. Specify what constitutes success.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_PxyDYGHjeyG9ksVIF/file_8hDe3tTqc6q5HqOPI/267bf70a-1fd4-4a56-f7a1-8164c10c9d48zac_durant__6HzPU9Hyfg_unsplash_min.jpg)

A product one-pager outlines the ""why"" of a specific effort and what the company should anticipate as a consequence of the initiative from the outset of the process.

As at this point, there are no specific measurements or milestones to work towards. There should be sufficient clarity to allow the implementation team to determine whether or not they are on the correct track. In addition, stakeholders utilize the one-pager to keep up with the progress of the application.

## Key Characteristics of a Product One-Pager that Stand Out from the Competition

That which distinguishes a fantastic one-pager from another is its design. Here are five things to bear in mind while writing one of these critical product briefings for your company's product. These are essential to know.

### Conciseness

By definition, a one-pager is already very condensed and concise. These are masterclasses in succinctness, and they stand out as motivators for stakeholders. In certain cases, even a single page of paper might seem like an uphill battle to get through because it is too thick and overloaded with information.

Executives are juggling a lot of responsibilities. They want information that is presented in bite-sized, value-packed bits so that they can analyze, make a choice, and then go on with their lives.

Please be considerate of their time. Keep in mind that your project is only one of several ideas that they are considering.

### Make certain that all of the bases are covered.

Despite the fact that it must be concise and to the point, your product one-pager documentation must not have any obvious flaws or key unsolved loopholes. It should always have the following components:

### Goal

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_PxyDYGHjeyG9ksVIF/file_xZpI8I6nIRoWUOFWR/02af5a28-7f5c-682d-8bcc-f3734f9f940aafif_kusuma_RjqCk9MqhNg_unsplash_min.jpg)

What is the motivation behind your proposal? What is it that you aim to accomplish? It should be noted that this is distinct from product or business objectives and is particular to the ""why"" of this project.

### What is the definition of success?

What are the conditions that must be met in order for this venture to be considered a success if we achieve this (and do it well)?

* **Backstory: **This should include answers to some supporting ""why"" questions, such as why there is a need or opportunity, why now is the best moment to begin, and why your company/product is well-positioned to be successful.

* **Items that are a 'must-have': **While this should not be a comprehensive list of requirements, it should include those that are absolutely necessary in version 1.0 in order for this effort to fulfill the aim and meet the success criteria previously established. This will also assist stakeholders in gaining a better understanding of the magnitude of the project's potential scope.

* **Items that are not covered under the scope of the project: **While this does not have to be a thorough list, it is here that you may express the needs for this phase of the project (or at all). Limit this to criteria that are connected to the scope and that stakeholders could expect to be included. For example, being able to import data or supporting a certain platform are both desirable. It should draw attention to locations where scope creep might become a problem in the future.

* **Competition: **What steps are being taken to resolve this issue now? What strategies are existing rivals doing to cope with this problem? What obstacles must be overcome in order to get a sufficient proportion of the market? Are there any other technologies or techniques that others have thought about or attempted in the past? What is the current market share of your company? Providing answers to these questions demonstrate that you have done your study and helps to define the terrain.

* **Timing factors that are critical: **While it is early to develop a project plan or timetable for this new venture, there may be a critical reason to complete it by a certain date. A major industry event, a contractual deadline for a client, a seasonal window of opportunity, or even the necessity to replace a failing internal system are just a few examples. Stakeholders must be informed if there is a sense of urgency or if there are any specific time limits to bear in mind.



All of this information can be filled out and done on [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/). By doing this you can export your files into a PDF format, or email the documentation with our online cloud link. It all can be password protected so that outsiders won't be able to access this information who are outside this project.

### The emphasis is on the impact.

**Due to the fact that product one-pagers are not product specifications, you do not need to provide a long list of needs.** The goal here is to get support for the effort as far as possible. It is more important to understand why this is a good thing for the company as opposed to how it will operate or what it would look like.

Maintain your emphasis on strategy alignment and how a successful implementation may impact the key metrics that matter to the company's performance. If there is no overlap with the organization's areas of emphasis, it is hard to justify the expenditure of the necessary resources.

It may also provide insight into what the business stands to lose if they do not proceed with the project. For example, falling behind rivals, losing critical clients, or being hamstrung by technological debt are all possible outcomes of not partaking in a particular opportunity the product holds. There's nothing worse than realizing too late that you've lost out on a giant opportunity and there's nothing you can do to make it right. 

### Well research cases

The product one-pager, on the other hand, does not provide much space for explanation. Every assertion, assumption, and forecast is based on facts and data that can be verified. If this supporting information is not included in the one-pager, the hypotheses and outcomes addressed will still be based on reasonable assumptions. They should be able to withstand any obstacles that may arise in the future.

Equally crucial, the project suggested in the product one-pager must have realistic and sensible expectations for its objectives. Product team members should be able to stand by the outcomes of the project from the beginning to the end of its lifecycle. Those objectives may not be as high or as wide as the previous ones. Setting expectations, on the other hand, will yield benefits in terms of both the project's success and your personal credibility.

### The Art of Storytelling

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_WxPJSQ5gsES8Bzjxy/doc_PxyDYGHjeyG9ksVIF/file_itHAB8wKJWNIx2JOw/5f957e51-ed6f-7752-fb9c-c49654ac1e9cnong_v_9pw4TKvT3po_unsplash.jpg)

A complicated tale cannot be told on a single page because of the limited space available. A one-pager that is intriguing must communicate an inspirational narrative. They all follow a similar plotline, albeit the nuances and details might differ greatly.

In a nutshell, you establish the scene by stating the existing condition of affairs. Following that, you do consumer research to establish a market demand. Following that, you should provide a short summary of the recommended solution or technique to fulfill this requirement.

Then you explain why this solution will meet the need and how it fits into the wider competitive environment. Finish your story by describing the ramifications of a successful implementation and deployment in terms of effect. The organization has placed a high priority on promoting the product or business strategy, as well as on influencing any key performance indicators or other measures. However, these bite-sized business cases do serve to establish the tone for the project's future.

## Creating a Solid One-Pager for Future Achievement

In any given year, you may only have a few opportunities to drive a major new project forward. When the opportunity presents itself, it is well worth the time and effort to boil everything down into a crystal clear one-pager for all stakeholders to understand.

### Documentation of the Product Strategy

everyone involved understands what they're getting into and what their ultimate objectives are. With these clearly stated, you will be able to guarantee that everyone is on the same page, that all teams and departments are working towards the same goals, and that all departments are prioritizing the same things.

### Description of the product specification documentation

Because it consolidates all of the information about your app, product, or service into one location, this kind of documentation is critical to success. In this section, you may concentrate on anything, including actual product specifics, feature lists, aesthetic and marketing materials, as well as sales and branding tactics.

Of course, the contents of each of these papers and the priorities may vary based on the sort of product you are developing, but clearly articulating your objectives can aid in bringing everyone together and in getting things organized.

### Documentation of the Competitive Analysis

When it comes to your company's success, being one step ahead of your competitors in terms of knowing how their goods and services function is very essential. This is particularly true when it comes to recognizing strengths and weaknesses and acting on them.

In order to be more successful, you must not only analyze the firm but also have a deep understanding of its operations and operations procedures, as well as what it is doing.

### Documents of Metrics

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_TW7xFF3ucs3XCi5rY/file_IlAjgRwtpwBDVKehx/1176f518-721f-89e5-5db5-cbc46719944dstephen_dawson_qwtCeJ5cLYs_unsplash_min.jpg)

""How much are you spending?""

The answers to these questions are very significant when it comes to determining the direction your project is moving in, determining your priorities, and determining what actions you must do in order to reach your objectives.

**Documentation for Prototyping**

It is inevitable that you will reach a point in your product development project when you will be testing the designs of your ideas and determining which strategy would work best moving ahead. It's likely that you'll also be producing some kind of prototype in order to determine how successful the whole project will be in the long run, as well.

Through the documentation of the whole process, you'll be able to identify and address major areas of concern, as well as audit your process in order to improve and optimize your approach in order to get better outcomes today and in future projects.

**Documentation for Prototyping**

If you are involved in a product development project, it is unavoidable that you will reach a moment when you will be testing the designs of your ideas and choosing which method would perform best going forward. As part of your project, it's probable that you'll be creating some kind of prototype in order to establish how successful the whole endeavor will be in the long run.

You will be able to identify and resolve important areas of concern as a result of the documenting of the whole process. You will also be able to audit your process in order to enhance and optimize your approach in order to get better results now and in future projects.

### Documentation for User Guides and Manuals

There’s a lot of material that you’ll need to think about creating while your product is being created for when it’s finally released to the public and/or your customers to create the best experience possible. Here are a few examples of this kind of documentation:

**• Internet-based resources: such as knowledge bases, and help guides**

**• Frequently Asked Questions**

**• Instruction manuals for products**

**• Internal policies and procedures for your company's usage**

Here's everything you'll need to think about when it comes to generating documentation for end-users as well as for your workers. In the event that a client contacts your company about a problem with their product, you'll need to ensure that your personnel are trained on how to resolve the issue in the fastest and most efficient way.

### Documentation of the User Stories

When designing a product, it's critical to understand the types of clients and end-users with whom you'll be collaborating, as well as how your product will touch their lives and benefit them in a good manner, before moving further.

### Documentation for road mapping and projections

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_TW7xFF3ucs3XCi5rY/file_T16bjL6bQTUr7TVXC/719e3d22-1b8a-62db-10bc-142c5c0a2201alvaro_reyes_qWwpHwip31M_unsplash_min.jpg)

By road mapping the project, you'll be able to clearly specify what type of timeframe your project is intended to last for, as well as establish critical milestones with target completion dates to strive for in order to achieve your objectives. This is an excellent document to utilize since it will allow you to ensure that everything is on track, as well as to identify and solve important problem areas before they become a source of concern or worry for anybody.

### Final thoughts

As you can see, there are a plethora of different types of documentation that you'll need to consider and prioritize when working on a product as a product manager. Overall, the more organized and in control, you can be during the process, the better your ultimate outcome will be. Docsie has a robust feature set of tools to help you accomplish any task to create uplifting and promising documentation for your clients, stakeholders, and associates.

12/17/2021 11:01:11,Tal F.,"*Documentation is one of the most crucial and underappreciated components of any open-source project, and it should not be taken lightly.*

Generally speaking, most open source projects do not get adequate attention simply because their authors are not really interested in, are incapable of, or do not have the time to create an effective documentation environment for their API and product documentation.

Although your application may be excellent, if the documentation is inadequate, consumers will not be able to benefit from its usage.

However, even if they have no option but to utilize it for whatever reason, they will not be able to do it successfully or in the manner in which you would like them to.

Understanding how to produce excellent documentation takes a significant amount of work, as does periodically reviewing other documentation projects. But take my word for it — as someone who has created a plethora of documentation for Docsie – if you are building code that will be used by someone other than yourself, and particularly if those people are your customers, your product should be well documented, formatted and dynamically presented.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_IDYTWOaZCuq9mWwra/file_1Og3QffsTgFL8pV68/0aa542c6-d2ff-4d6e-42aa-932d7f3665eeschool_supplies_ga298c5a8e_1280_min_(1).jpg)

## When it comes to tutorials, how-to’s, explanations, and references, what is the difference?

Many people mistakenly believe that the four phrases refer to the same item. They do, however, express a variety of diverse meanings. These different types of documentations are quite essential and have some key differences:

**Tutorials Documentation:** These types of documentation are information-based documentation oriented for training.

**How-To Guides/User Guides Documentation: **User guides documentations express how to solve specific problems through a series of steps in order to achieve a specific objective.

**Explanation Documentation: **These are article-type documentation that is designed to help the user/reader gain a deeper understanding of a product through various explanations and background context.

**Reference Notes Documentation:** This documentation is designed to inform the user of the description of various new feature updates and uses. This type of documentation can be very ‘raw’ in the form of developer documentation however, they can also be translated into more user-friendly release notes which can be easily understood by the end-user.

## Reasons for producing high-quality documentation

Before proceeding, it is crucial to comprehend why competent documentation writing is a very important yet underappreciated need in today's society. The availability of extensive and well-written documentation is one of the most important criteria in achieving widespread adoption, particularly in open source projects where practically every action is available to the public and where such activities play a crucial role in the project's success.

Let's have a look at the most important reasons for writing effective documentation.

### It allows you to create a better onboarding experience for your customers.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_IDYTWOaZCuq9mWwra/file_kSeCio30GIM0RDS3J/2259983f-291d-fe8e-3cdd-6db630023e96ecommerce_g99f922364_1920_min_(1).jpg)

When you provide adequate documentation on your product to your customers, you will assist them by making them feel more comfortable with your product, and protected by its specific guidelines. You must do the following in order for this to occur:

1. Ensure that your product documentation is visible and easily accessible, either through in-app links or under a searchable documentation platform.

2. Ensure that they are well written and assist the customer in finding their answer quickly and easily

One piece of advice is to write your documentation just once, and it will be digested again and over again when new clients are brought aboard by your company.

### As a consequence, there are fewer support inquiries.

Customers who read and understand your documentation are more likely to purchase your goods. When clients are unable to figure anything out, it may be quite aggravating, and they may begin to blame your product instead.

Some customers may instantly contact or email the support staff if they encounter a snag; but, if the documentation is attractive, easily accessible, and intelligible, they will be able to resolve their own issues without the need to consult you, which will, in turn, make them feel more empowered.

### It helps you to support your own team.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_8D5W1pxgb7Jq3oZO7/doc_IDYTWOaZCuq9mWwra/file_oqXlcrJlQmjhGonqx/9f439b91-9f8f-343e-67c2-0291ec0da5f8teamwork_g8ce998b1c_1920_min_(1).jpg)

A robust knowledge base may also be used to help your own team members. So your internal team should be informed about new features, planned roadmaps, API documentation, and everything else that is necessary to keep everyone on the same page.

### Step-by-step instructions on how to write effective documentation

Writing the substance of the document and arranging this activity are two entirely distinct tasks from determining what tone to use and how to ensure that your documentation is understandable. As stated by [O’Reilly, there are 8 rules of excellent documentation](https://www.oreilly.com/content/the-eight-rules-of-good-documentation/): 

1. **Create documentation that is inviting to the reader.**

2. **Produce thorough documentation that covers all areas of the project.**

3. **Produce skimmable material that is easy to understand.**

4. **Create documentation that demonstrates how to utilize the product via case studies.**

5. **Write documentation that contains repetition where it is necessary.**

6. **Write documentation that is up to date**

7. **Write documentation that is simple to contribute to**

8. **Write documentation that is simple to discover and understand**

Those elements are mostly concerned with the content. Following that, we'll go into the ""how"" of structuring this information in six steps:

### Make a decision on what you should record.

Take some time to consider what sort of documentation you will be producing before starting: is it a tutorial, a reference document, an instruction manual, or an explanation?

Take note that the nature of your product will have a direct impact on the sort of documentation you will be responsible for creating.

### Create a framework.

Build a foundation for your documentation first. This may be something very tiny at the start, and it can comprise just a few groups, but over time, the whole platform on which you are constructing will begin to grow in size and complexity. You should review your organizational structure on a regular basis.

Keep in mind that you are the instructor, and you are ultimately accountable for how your pupils learn in your class. They will be directed by your directions; thus, the more time you spend on structure, the more successful your pupils will be in their endeavors.

### Always take advantage of sound multimedia techniques.

Make sure you make use of videos, drawings, and varied styles and plug them directly into your documentation. [Docsie ](https://www.docsie.io/)allows embedding any of these within our platform to make this process easier.

Not only will they assist consumers in better understanding the information you express, but they will also give a fantastic Search Engine Optimization which will lead to a larger number of high-quality leads as a result of your dynamic documentation.

### Make certain that it is searchable.

There are differences in the search capabilities of different knowledgebase platforms — some of them only offer basic search with no ability to drill down into segmentations (which is technically fine if you don't have thousands of files), while others offer query options that allow you to search not only in documents but also in usernames.

However, there is one thing that is critical: you should be utilizing a tool that allows you to search quickly. A search feature included within the app makes it simple to search for files and get a preview of them without leaving the app.

Docsie allows you to have dynamically searchable navigation for easily accessible information.

### Constantly strive to improve and update

Creating and using documents is difficult because they are quickly forgotten by the individuals who generated or profited from them. Documents also face a number of challenges along their journey.

As time passes, the folder structure takes on the appearance of a cemetery, as older documentation tends to remain at a lower position on the monitor's screen.

So be sure to go back through your old documentation and make improvements, as well as encourage your colleagues to do the same from time to time. Docsie allows you to create updates through our advanced versioning system which is simple and easy to do.

As part of a wider marketing strategy, product managers and product team members should continue reading to learn about 15 best practices to follow during their next launch. By the end, you will understand how to make these important documents the best they can be!

**What Types of Product Documentation Should I Be Aware Of?**

Before diving into the list of best practices, let us clarify what types of product documentation exist, and the intended goal for each:

* **Product Requirements Documentation** – A product requirements document or PRD is a type of internal product documentation used to help businesses meet release criteria. This explains what the final product should accomplish for a user, without specifically defining how or where. Then, development teams and testing teams use a PRD to align the product with business requirements ready for release. PRDs are commonplace with software products, but can be used to adhere to any product roadmap.

* **User Guides and Self Service** – Product teams will need to create user guides as a soft prerequisite for a successful product launch. As the name suggests, this is documentation to help end-users maximize their productivity when using a new product. Here, all major user-facing functionality should be explained in full, so customers can get the most value. Better yet, share these guides in a self-service external knowledge base so customers can help themselves!



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_Eaf0xsgp4QfJLQPUN/file_cWXkDOoQWZe4VTtxB/3f77ef88-6b1c-476b-00bf-403bf0fd3f7dimage.png)





* **Setup, Installation and Configuration Guides** – If a product requires setup, installation and configuration, this is another technical product documentation asset you will need to create. The goal is to clearly illustrate these processes from a user perspective, and a developer perspective if applicable. This may span across multiple devices and multiple operating systems if for software documentation; something to bear in mind.

* **Marketing Assets** – You may not think this is product documentation, but it is! The style and format of marketing assets influences how customers perceive your product, before they start using it. Making a good impression is vital. How are you describing the products new features? What audience is it intended for? How will this improve someone’s work or personal life? Is this what you and the wider company want customers to think?





After that primer on product docs, next up is the list of best practices:

## 1: Make a Start!

Just starting out with product documentation? Great! Now, don’t hesitate to make a start. Many people want to get product documentation PERFECT; and in pursuit of perfection, they become paralyzed by the task. Get the basic concept for your services on paper, then focus on tidying up ready to impress your customers. Release notes are great at defining the basics, then you can build out from this document.





![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_Eaf0xsgp4QfJLQPUN/file_Emt4IHPuQCw8QvlWh/de7b651e-3c21-5769-3d3c-98b10afa2861image.png)

## 2: Keep it Simple, Stupid…

Abbreviated as KISS, this is a real design principle that floated around (pun intended) in the US navy in the 60s. The same rule can apply to product documentation. Ask yourself: “How can you convey the necessary information in a way that all demographics can understand?”

To apply this to your product vision, we recommend the Flesch-Kincaid readability test. Content grading tools like Grammarly commonly use this system. This gives you a score equivalent to a US high school grade when analyzing written content. Aim for grade 8 or age 13 to 14 as a schooling age to maximize the interpretability of content – wait, we could’ve said… how easy it is to understand your writing.

**3: Understand the Target Audience**

So, you’ve started, and kept it simple. Now, you need to know who you are actually writing for… As an example, the target audience for software companies will be very different to an automotive manufacturer.

Let’s imagine an educational software company that focuses on simple tools to help young students learn step by step about concepts. The first thought in your head may be, “so, the target audience is children, right?”. Not necessarily... The target audience is the primary decision maker for software packages at a kindergarten or high school – such as the IT department and internal stakeholders in charge of procurement. A secondary audience would be the young students, who may see the education software in the wild and advocate for its use in their school.

**4: Focus on the Value, Rather Than a Story**

While everyone loves a good story, customers want to know what value your product will offer. Will it simplify a task or workflow? Is your product available offline, versus competitors who are online only? Does your product do the thing faster than other competing products?

These examples constitute unique selling points (USP) for a particular offering. Focusing on and highlighting USPs will tempt prospective customers, and help them understand what you have that others don’t to increase market share. You can define USPs by performing a competitive analysis against competitors in your industry. 

**5: Leverage Formatting to Categorize Information**

Documentation should not be a big block of text. This is difficult to scan through and navigate for end users. Instead, use headings and other formatting options to break up the text.

H1 headings are the first thing people see when clicking on a page. H2 and H3 act as sub headings for topics covered on the page. You can use bullet points or numbered lists to group content together for easy reading, and even become eligible for Rich Snippets to improve SEO and SERPS visibility. If you have Markdown knowledge, an online markdown editor like Docsie offers numerous formatting options to make your product documents stand out!

**6: Keep Your Documentation in a Central Location**

There’s nothing worse than releasing technical documentation, and then realising how complicated it will be to monitor and manage long term. What if documentation needs an update? Where is the original document, and how can we release new versions of the page? How about translating this content into other languages?

For this best practice, we have to mention Docsie! Online knowledge base software allows you to store documents in a single centralized cloud location. From here, employees and contractors can collaborate on content to expedite completion ready for launch. Docsie offers version control management when you need to update knowledge, and language management for global content localization. If you wanted to automate global content creation, we also have a nifty ghost AI language translation bot that accurately translates for you in the background!

**7: A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words**

While writing a long-winded explanation on how to do the thing will work, it’s not an effective way of teaching end users. Instead, show them with pictures, or even moving pictures!

Try creating an accompanying video tutorial for each product document. That way, those who prefer reading can scan through the text, while visual learners can opt for the video. Similarly, GIFs and images can help users see what you are referring to, especially within a software user interface (UI). Accommodating for a range of learning styles will help you help a wider range of users, meaning more potential for your product.

**8: Learning vs Goals vs Understanding vs Information**

What is the intent for the document? User intent is critical with online product documentation, and helps you align your content to sections of the user journey.

1. **Learning** – If a person has never seen a thing before, learning content helps them understand the basic principles.

2. **Goals** – This type of content should help users reach a goal, such as ‘How to Export a PDF File From Docsie’. By the end, the user will have achieved the goal: exporting a PDF.

3. **Understanding** – Also referred to as research, this is for customers who already have working knowledge on a subject, but want to understand in more depth.

4. **Information** – The subject has a question, and wants a specific answer. This could be as simple as the real time weather in a specific location, or a video on ‘how to build a tree house.’

**9: Make it Searchable**

Before you make this documentation public, can your users search for keywords within the text?

If not, we recommend finding a documentation platform that supports this. The number one deterrent for users is not being able to quickly find information. This leads to frustration, additional customer support team workloads if they cannot find the info, and a negative overall customer experience (CX). Oh, Docsie does support global search if you were wondering!

**10: Preparing to Gather Actionable Feedback**

Documentation writers will be aware of the fact that the initial version of the content is bound to change down the line. Until the public sees the documentation, your writers can only bounce ideas and feedback off one another.

Once your documentation is published, we believe it is essential to have feedback collection in place. That way, your writers can turn any content-related negatives into positives by listening to real customers and end users. No need to look elsewhere, you can take advantage of feedback collection in Docsie!





**11: Link to a Page When Mentioning a Topic**

This best practice leans into SEO and web page navigational structures.

When you mention a keyword, do you link to it? When you reference other topics, users may not yet understand the other topic in the context of the current page. You should link to any mentioned topics that have documentation, as this allows readers to quickly reference sub-topics while learning about a main topic.

**12: Clarity, Not Ambiguity**

Clarity beats ambiguity when writing product documentation. You can use plain English to avoid ambiguity, which basically means avoiding jargon and technical language unless absolutely necessary. If you do use jargon, be sure to write a simplified definition immediately after for layperson readers.

“If you are having issues with comprehending information in this documentation, please ask for additional details on how to overcome this comprehension difficulty from our customer support representative.”

“If the content displayed is hard to understand, you can ask customer support for help.”

Which do you prefer?

**13: Create Templates to Make Documents Faster**

With a new product launching, expediting the documentation creation process is a priority. You can do this using templates.

Templates define a reusable structure for pages, helping writers create content faster and with more consistency. You can also create multiple templates for different content styles. Docsie offers a range of prebuilt templates for you to use, alongside custom template support.

**14: Establish a Tone of Voice and Style Guide for Writers**

How much free reign do your writers have?

Reigning writers in is important, as this can lead to inconsistency in final drafts of product documentation. You can do this with Tone of Voice (ToV) guidelines, and content writing style guides.

* **Tone of Voice** – It’s not what you said… it’s the way you said it. Do you want writers to be formal and proper, or more casual? Is humor allowed, or are the topics more serious? Is your content more conversational and passionate, or do you just want cold-hard facts?

* **Style Guidelines** – This document may explain the company mission statement, and how writers can follow a set style when writing and formatting pages. Included here could be user personas to target, SEO principles like meta descriptions, and citation or referencing requirements (Chicago, AP Style etc).

**15: Publish Your Documentation Using a Powerful Knowledge Base Platform**

If your written content is fuel, what vehicle are you using to drive the message home?

A powerful knowledge base platform is essential for deploying quality product documentation. If documents become unavailable, or pages are slow to load, all the effort spent creating these documents will go to waste.

You need the ability to import existing documents, collaborate on content with internal teams, create and edit new documents, embed dynamic rich content, and publish to a knowledge site. Version control is also critical for long term documentation updates, alongside language management and auto translation for global content localization.

1/7/2023 22:15:51,Tal F,"ITglue users seek alternatives because of:

* Poor customer support

* High cost for smaller teams

* Lack of documentation tools

We’ve reviewed 15 MSP tools and found the best 5 ITglue alternatives based on those criteria.

Here's our verdict.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_2vo5bp82HQcxRk6a0/fdcc5cad-22ec-14cf-521f-4ea8925c71b5image.png)

## Buying Guide

We've categorised the software based on four criteria most important for MSPs.

**Ease of Use:** reflects how quickly you'll learn to use the app. If it's too difficult to use or takes too long to learn, it will *decrease* your team's productivity instead of improving it.

**Customer Service:** problems are inevitable when connecting *a lot *of different apps. That’s why the quality of customer service is a deciding factor for many MSPs.

**Knowledge Base Features:** Can an app handle large knowledge bases? Does it offer editing tools to create functional documents? Can you collaborate across teams and third-party apps? You don’t want to switch software only to find that it limits you in some way.

**Value For Money:** Will the tool grow with you—or will you have to switch *again* with scale? A good tool will support you at any level and only introduce features that you need.

### Are low scores always bad?

Not at all.

For example, a tool with integrated project management will have a higher *value *score, since you'll find it useful if you aren’t already using a project management app. But if you are, those features only add *complexity, *which ultimately decreases the value.

Similarly, having few features might mean that the existing features are of higher quality. That’s the case with specialised tools like Docsie: it can’t manage passwords or devices, but it’s the best knowledge base platform out there.

## 1. Docsie.ai - Best App For Knowledge Base Management

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Mdm29hBsHFHmx4Mth/0735b5f9-52ef-0998-d6ab-147eb6dd463csnag_dcc60569.png)

### Features & Benefits

[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) is the best knowledge base management tools out there.

It specializes in **extensive IT documentation, cross-organizational data curation, and team collaboration**. Docsie is very easy to install and can integrate with any tech stack.

**Top Docsie Features:**

● Auto-Translate

● UI Customization

● Publishing Options

● Powerful Editing Tools

● Documentation Analytics

● Deployment Management

● Interactive Knowledge Portals

● Intuitive Organization Structure

● Internal & External Collaboration

Here's [an example](https://portals.docsie.io/organization_14776/workspace_14776/welcome-to-docsie-red-beta-snead/welcome-to-docsieio/deployment_EmlWqzYM4A1oC5jcF/?doc=/welcome-to-docsieio/) of Docsie's documentation published on the web.



Docsie's building blocks are *books *and *shelves*.

*Shelves* are placed on the left side. Opening them will show you a list of *books*.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_pKrfGL3xBNPw0VWzy/467dfdac-7622-ba62-48be-cd614fe2882cimage.png)

You can group books into sections, like a real library.

Clicking on a book takes you to the editor. Here, you can create *articles*, and even translate them into *different languages* automatically. The editor is also where you manage the versions, visibility, and publishing for each article.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ey4kVnSN6KS0puzDz/5b540e19-1e98-570f-b887-f85735fbd178image.png)

You can embed multimedia content in articles, allowing you to create all kinds of documents — **internal SOPs, onboarding guides, and external wikis or help centers. **To stay secure, Docsie also offers robust access control.

As for publishing, you can publish whole shelves *or*single books.



**Cloud Portal**

You can use Docsie’s cloud to publish your document to the web.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Jcp0r6LpQjkYzeSXo/35e85914-9d15-68ae-ca3b-b40ee8b596f9image.png)

This creates a web link that you can share with anyone you want.

Meaning your readers don’t need a Docsie account to access your knowledge bases.



### Website Embed

**You can also embed a Docsie knowledge portal into an existing website.**

That means you can create and curate help centers, guides, blogs, and product documentation, and make them public on your website.

To find out about the full extent of Docsie features, check out our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQm591jTzvHwb003Y8e1XA/videos). We’ve got a ton of videos explaining how it works. It’s so simple you can figure it out in one afternoon and have it running by the end of the day.

### Who Docsie.io Isn’t For

Docsie is a *specialized knowledge base*.

It doesn’t include asset management for passwords, devices, or customers. You'll have to get separate software for those. But fear not because Docsie has robust [integration capabilities](https://www.docsie.io/es/vocally/documentation/integrations/), and can fit in any tech stack.

It’s a great option if you want to keep your tech stack flexible with specialized apps.

### Pricing

**The Docsie “startup” plan is free.**

It includes all the features you need to create and curate your knowledge base so you can get a good idea of how it works before committing to it. Higher plans have more features as shown below:



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_bJdTHHD4FfqgxQSA4/4749b3c6-22ed-c6b0-9a6b-81eeadcffb51snag_dce44cb2.png)

It’s worth mentioning that anyone can see the knowledge bases you create, as long as you make them public. Meaning you **don’t need a team account for every user that wants access to the documents**.

### Bottom line

**Docsie is a documentation specialist.**

If you’re looking to expand your tech stack with a best-in-class knowledge base… or if you don’t need the complexity of a general MSP software like ITglue… then Docsie is the best solution.

## 2. Hudu - Best Direct Alternative To ITglue

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_pCiGVBAQWgNoH1YKO/10d972b6-df42-5ddd-da03-70930f8a9314snag_dcef3bc4.png)

### Features & Benefits

[Hudu](https://www.hudu.com/) is the newcomer on the MSP block that everyone is talking about. It’s a direct competitor to ITglue so it will be right up your alley if you’re an ITglue veteran.

**Top Hudu Features:**

● Custom assets

● Expiration tracking

● Website monitoring

● Intelligent reporting

● Knowledge retention

● Employee accountability

● It acts as a password vault

● Secure information sharing

● Built-in process management

Unlike ITglue, Hudu is self-hosted, so your data security is in your hands instead of a third-party’s.

Another reason why Hudu took the market by storm is its customer service. Many users report faster response times and better problem-solving than what ITglue offers.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Ld8qvOUPjWopB9SBl/06c352a7-76cc-d45e-e5c1-26d91ca5706aimage.png)

Check out [this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzkf25_e-2g&ab_channel=Hudu) if you want to get a better feel for Hudu and its features.

### Where Hudu Falls Short

If you’re switching from ITglue, you should know that Hudu isn’t as feature-rich. Although the dev team has a fast release cycle and is catching up fast. Especially since Hudu listens to customer feedback a lot more than ITglue does.

Another consideration is the current lack of a hosted service, which is still in development.

### Pricing

[Hudu’s pricing](https://www.hudu.com/pricing.html) is simple.

**$31/month for 3 users + $15/user/month for additional users.**

It has a 14-day free trial and no setup fees or contracts. Annual billing plans come with a 10% discount.

### Bottom line

Many unhappy ITglue customers flocked to Hudu since it launched.

It’s the best option if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to ITglue but don’t want to compromise on any functionality.

It’s also worth mentioning that compared to Docsie, both Hudu and ITglue are more expensive, and their knowledge base and documentation features aren’t as advanced.

## 3. Confluence - Best For Large Teams And Organizations

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_kFQZd3eXlOJsxQyQ8/c3d00fb6-7c3f-f43c-ba76-488dcdf25f21snag_dcf13f74.png)

### Features & Benefits

[Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)is a collaboration tool from Atlassian.

It allows you to create project plans, schedule tasks, write meeting notes, discuss work, and submit project requirements in a collaborative work environment. It also offers documentation management and the creation of internal wikis. By syncing documents, you can collaborate online for document creation.

**Top Confluence Features:**

● Analytics

● Atlassian integrations

● Robust customer support

● Unlimited spaces and pages

● Team & Project management

● Internal & External Collaboration

● Powerful permission management

Confluence is lauded as a stable product and it allows easy integration with agile processes.

Here’s [a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZJmdvoXeQs&ab_channel=RCVAcademy) if you’re interested in how Confluence works.

### Where Confluence Falls Short

Confluence is a complex program.

For new users, the syntax is confusing and it takes a while to learn how to navigate the program. Also, Confluence is the worst on this list in terms of knowledge base management.

### Pricing

Confluence has a generous free version. It includes all of the essential documentation features—including unlimited pages and spaces—for a team of 10 users.

Confluence is also the cheapest paid product on this list. However, it’s worth mentioning that advanced features are only available as paid plugins which can quickly ramp up the cost.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Hc9ZKEDEPhAsLYLfe/df69b0b8-42e5-2df3-9d57-ac0433f7f02bsnag_dcf32933.png)

### Bottom line

Confluence is a no-brainer if you’re already using other Atlassian apps like Jira. It's also the best choice for massive teams since the base product's pricing plans are very scalable.

The major drawback is the subpar documentation features, which get convoluted if you’re dealing with large knowledge bases.

## 4. IT Portal - Best For Small Teams

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_1fv8wS3rWKb8RG3Ej/78d2c20d-e0b6-8d75-a40d-e4a713dc9f5aimage.png)

### Features & Benefits

[IT Portal](https://www.it-portal.com/v4/) is a flexible asset management software. You can use it to keep track of knowledge bases, docs, passwords, people, and configurations that can run on their cloud or your own.

Compared to ITglue, IT Portal is more straightforward to use and more customizable. It's responsive, quick, and stable. And all the information is reachable with the browser extension plugin.

**Notable IT Portal Features:**

● Mobile App

● Scoreboard

● Portal Export

● Device Import

● Network Import

● Integrated File Editors

● Password Manager & Browser Plugin

IT Portal is known to have better customer support than ITglue: quick to respond and fast to action.

The integration feature is also nothing to sneeze at. It integrates with various common software like RMM, Office365, ticket management, etc. which further enriches the value of your tech stack.

### Where IT Portal Falls Short

In terms of features, both products are very similar. But IT Portal's UI is awkward and feels outdated compared to ITglue.

### Pricing

IT Portal is priced per number of users — the more users, the less per user you have to pay.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_QUjnR2SvHrfGixfp2/f91bf950-daf7-18ab-e5fa-05c5a9c9271esnag_dcf4d82b.png)

They also provide on-premise hosting.



![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_sCjJmF9mDYBBNTTOg/f3d2ce97-53e3-0921-fd97-76c88fe69096snag_dcf537cf.png)

If you buy a yearly plan, they offer a 10% discount for up to 9 users and a 20% discount above that.

They also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee if you want to test it out.

### Bottom line

IT Portal is a cheap alternative to ITglue for small teams, but its costs quickly balloon for larger teams if you aren’t hosting it yourself. It’s a good ITglue alternative if the dated UI doesn’t bother you.

**Compared to Hudu:** If price is a big factor for you, chose Hudu. Otherwise—if you don’t care about the UI—It comes down to the integrations. We recommend looking at what integrations you want and choosing based on that.

## 5. DokuWiki - Best Free Alternative

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_D4NBY2yrE0P4lqaKw/5283b22f-4f66-6d03-241e-c4bac208c23esnag_dcf5f478.png)

### Features & Benefits

[DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) is a simple to use and versatile open source wiki software.

It features a clean and easy-to-read syntax. As the name implies, DokuWiki is made for documentation, manuals, and descriptions. It’s possible to create nicely formatted and easy-to-read documentation with its editing tools.

**Notable DokuWiki Features:**

● Backup and integration

● Built-in access controls

● Features revision control

● Authentication connectors

● Integrates with your website

DokuWiki lets you create your own or community-made plugins to add any feature you like. The many plugins contributed by its community enable a broad range of uses beyond those of a typical wiki.

### Where DokuWiki Falls Short

DokuWiki was released in 2004 and hasn’t been updated since.

Because of that, it doesn’t look as clean as modern-day apps. It also has security risks that can be mitigated with proper network access configuration.

The original creators also don’t offer any official customer support, although many organizations offer [officially recognized third-party support services](https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq:support) in DokuWiki’s ecosystem.

### Pricing

DokuWiki is free.

### Bottom line

DokuWiki is a good choice if you’re ok with the older look and don’t have *any*budget to spend on other options. Security is a concern though, so it’s smart to upgrade to a paid tool after your business grows.

*If you're looking for a cutting-edge knowledge base tool that offers top-notch security and accessibility, Docsie.io is the perfect collaborative environment. Sign-up for the free version h[ere!](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/)*

## Final Verdict: Which ITglue alternative should you choose?

It’ll be different for every team or MSP, but every product offers a free trial that lets you test what’s best for you risk-free.

But if you ask us, if you're looking for a:

**powerful database management** tool that doesn’t work against you: [Docsie.io](https://www.docsie.io/),

1/7/2023 22:22:00,Tal F.,"One best practice when launching a new product is performing product release preparations. In particular, we want to focus on writing new product documentation to support a product launch. Without it, potential users will not have relevant information to use as a reference point after purchasing your new solution.

As part of a wider marketing strategy, product managers and product team members should continue reading to learn about 15 best practices to follow during their next launch. By the end, you will understand how to make these important documents the best they can be!

### What Types of Product Documentation Should I Be Aware Of?

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_9Scyi6wIT3bcJYGGD/95315aa5-2e75-88f7-8fb9-47bb7c34935asigmund_hstnjcvq798_unsplash.jpg)

Before diving into the list of best practices, let us clarify what types of product documentation exist, and the intended goal for each:

* **Product Requirements Documentation** – A product requirements document or PRD is a type of internal product documentation used to help businesses meet release criteria. This explains what the final product should accomplish for a user, without specifically defining how or where. Then, development teams and testing teams use a PRD to align the product with business requirements ready for release. PRDs are commonplace with software products, but can be used to adhere to any product roadmap.

* **User Guides and Self Service** – Product teams will need to create user guides as a soft prerequisite for a successful product launch. As the name suggests, this is documentation to help end-users maximise their productivity when using a new product. Here, all major user-facing functionality should be explained in full, so customers can get the most value. Better yet, share these guides in a self-service external knowledge base so customers can help themselves!

* **Setup, Installation and Configuration Guides** – If a product requires setup, installation and configuration, this is another technical product documentation asset you will need to create. The goal is to clearly illustrate these processes from a user perspective, and a developer perspective if applicable. This may span across multiple devices and multiple operating systems if for software documentation; something to bear in mind.

* **Marketing Assets** – You may not think this is product documentation, but it is! The style and format of marketing assets influences how customers perceive your product, before they start using it. Making a good impression is vital. How are you describing the products new features? What audience is it intended for? How will this improve someone’s work or personal life? Is this what you and the wider company want customers to think?

## 15 Best Practices for Documentation When Releasing New Products

After that primer on product docs, next up is the list of best practices:

### 1: Make a Start!

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_XRzDo0LGYp6Ik0zYw/4b74c23c-264d-2ef8-044e-b189c2580228christina_wocintechchat_com_pvimd8jdeye_unsplash.jpg)

Just starting out with product documentation? Great! Now, don’t hesitate to make a start. Many people want to get product documentation PERFECT; and in pursuit of perfection, they become paralyzed by the task. Get the basic concept for your services on paper, then focus on tidying up ready to impress your customers. Release notes are great at defining the basics, then you can build out from this document.

### 2: Keep it Simple, Stupid…

Abbreviated as KISS, this is a real design principle that floated around (pun intended) in the US navy in the 60s. The same rule can apply to product documentation. Ask yourself: “How can you convey the necessary information in a way that all demographics can understand?”

To apply this to your product vision, we recommend the Flesch-Kincaid readability test. Content grading tools like Grammarly commonly use this system. This gives you a score equivalent to a US high school grade when analysing written content. Aim for grade 8 or age 13 to 14 as a schooling age to maximise the interpretability of content – wait, we could’ve said… how easy it is to understand your writing.

### 3: Understand the Target Audience

So, you’ve started, and kept it simple. Now, you need to know who you are actually writing for… As an example, the target audience for software companies will be very different to an automotive manufacturer.

Let’s imagine an educational software company that focuses on simple tools to help young students learn step by step about concepts. The first thought in your head may be, “so, the target audience is children, right?”. Not necessarily... The target audience is the primary decision maker for software packages at a kindergarten or high school – such as the IT department and internal stakeholders in charge of procurement. A secondary audience would be the young students, who may see the education software in the wild and advocate for its use in their school.

### 4: Focus on the Value, Rather Than a Story

While everyone loves a good story, customers want to know what value your product will offer. Will it simplify a task or workflow? Is your product available offline, versus competitors who are online only? Does your product do the thing faster than other competing products?

These examples constitute unique selling points (USP) for a particular offering. Focusing on and highlighting USPs will tempt prospective customers, and help them understand what you have that others don’t to increase market share. You can define USPs by performing a competitive analysis against competitors in your industry.

### 5: Leverage Formatting to Categorize Information

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_iTjcLxAfp0Oo4PmOp/4205cc36-67d0-2823-abda-ab323bad3da9patrick_perkins_etrpjvb0km0_unsplash.jpg)

Documentation should not be a big block of text. This is difficult to scan through and navigate for end users. Instead, use headings and other formatting options to break up the text.

H1 headings are the first thing people see when clicking on a page. H2 and H3 act as sub headings for topics covered on the page. You can use bullet points or numbered lists to group content together for easy reading, and even become eligible for Rich Snippets to improve SEO and SERPS visibility. If you have Markdown knowledge, an online markdown editor like Docsie offers numerous formatting options to make your product documents stand out!

### 6: Keep Your Documentation in a Central Location

There’s nothing worse than releasing technical documentation, and then realising how complicated it will be to monitor and manage long term. What if documentation needs an update? Where is the original document, and how can we release new versions of the page? How about translating this content into other languages?

For this best practice, we have to mention Docsie! Online knowledge base software allows you to store documents in a single centralised cloud location. From here, employees and contractors can collaborate on content to expedite completion ready for launch. Docsie offers version control management when you need to update knowledge, and language management for global content localization. If you wanted to automate global content creation, we also have a nifty ghost AI language translation bot that accurately translates for you in the background!

### 7: A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words

While writing a long-winded explanation on how to do the thing will work, it’s not an effective way of teaching end users. Instead, show them with pictures, or even moving pictures!

Try creating an accompanying video tutorial for each product document. That way, those who prefer reading can scan through the text, while visual learners can opt for the video. Similarly, GIFs and images can help users see what you are referring to, especially within a software user interface (UI). Accommodating for a range of learning styles will help you help a wider range of users, meaning more potential for your product.

### 8: Learning vs Goals vs Understanding vs Information

What is the intent for the document? User intent is critical with online product documentation, and helps you align your content to sections of the user journey.

* **Learning** – If a person has never seen a thing before, learning content helps them understand the basic principles.

* **Goals** – This type of content should help users reach a goal, such as ‘How to Export a PDF File From Docsie’. By the end, the user will have achieved the goal: exporting a PDF.

* **Understanding** – Also referred to as research, this is for customers who already have working knowledge on a subject, but want to understand in more depth.

* **Information** – The subject has a question, and wants a specific answer. This could be as simple as the real time weather in a specific location, or a video on ‘how to build a tree house.’

### 9: Make it Searchable

Before you make this documentation public, can your users search for keywords within the text?

If not, we recommend finding a documentation platform that supports this. The number one deterrent for users is not being able to quickly find information. This leads to frustration, additional customer support team workloads if they cannot find the info, and a negative overall customer experience (CX). Oh, Docsie does support global search if you were wondering!

### 10: Preparing to Gather Actionable Feedback

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_AC7ODh4b2PHBa08er/204e31f9-3229-a56e-4a73-d27f71b554aacarlos_muza_hpjsku2uysu_unsplash.jpg)

Documentation writers will be aware of the fact that the initial version of the content is bound to change down the line. Until the public sees the documentation, your writers can only bounce ideas and feedback off one another.

Once your documentation is published, we believe it is essential to have feedback collection in place. That way, your writers can turn any content-related negatives into positives by listening to real customers and end users. No need to look elsewhere, you can take advantage of feedback collection in Docsie!

### 11: Link to a Page When Mentioning a Topic

This best practice leans into SEO and web page navigational structures.

When you mention a keyword, do you link to it? When you reference other topics, users may not yet understand the other topic in the context of the current page. You should link to any mentioned topics that have documentation, as this allows readers to quickly reference sub-topics while learning about a main topic.

### 12: Clarity, Not Ambiguity

Clarity beats ambiguity when writing product documentation. You can use plain English to avoid ambiguity, which basically means avoiding jargon and technical language unless absolutely necessary. If you do use jargon, be sure to write a simplified definition immediately after for layperson readers.

“If you are having issues with comprehending information in this documentation, please ask for additional details on how to overcome this comprehension difficulty from our customer support representative.”

“If the content displayed is hard to understand, you can ask customer support for help.”

Which do you prefer?

### 13: Create Templates to Make Documents Faster

With a new product launching, expediting the documentation creation process is a priority. You can do this using templates.

Templates define a reusable structure for pages, helping writers create content faster and with more consistency. You can also create multiple templates for different content styles. Docsie offers a range of prebuilt templates for you to use, alongside custom template support.

### 14: Establish a Tone of Voice and Style Guide for Writers

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Y5G9geSqU28MPuDxY/b0742029-5bd6-a649-282e-807f285c832eian_schneider_tammbr4okv4_unsplash.jpg)

How much free reign do your writers have?

Reigning writers in is important, as this can lead to inconsistency in final drafts of product documentation. You can do this with Tone of Voice (ToV) guidelines, and content writing style guides.

* **Tone of Voice** – It’s not what you said… it’s the way you said it. Do you want writers to be formal and proper, or more casual? Is humour allowed, or are the topics more serious? Is your content more conversational and passionate, or do you just want cold-hard facts?

* **Style Guidelines** – This document may explain the company mission statement, and how writers can follow a set style when writing and formatting pages. Included here could be user personas to target, SEO principles like meta descriptions, and citation or referencing requirements (Chicago, AP Style etc).

### 15: Publish Your Documentation Using a Powerful Knowledge Base Platform

If your written content is fuel, what vehicle are you using to drive the message home?

A powerful knowledge base platform is essential for deploying quality product documentation. If documents become unavailable, or pages are slow to load, all the effort spent creating these documents will go to waste.

You need the ability to import existing documents, collaborate on content with internal teams, create and edit new documents, embed dynamic rich content, and publish to a knowledge site. Version control is also critical for long term documentation updates, alongside language management and auto translation for global content localization.

You guessed it! All of these features are available in Docsie. Take these features for a spin, try our Free Forever plan to get started!

1/7/2023 22:24:35,Tal F.,"This faux pas taught me that I need to look at our product through the prism of the customer. Then the proverbial light switch clicked ""on."" If I deliver a product that addresses the customer's pain points, then support it with professional product documentation, we will have a winner.

And I also discovered creating professional, aesthetically pleasing, and easy-to-read product documentation was not an easy task. But when done correctly, product documentation can make happy customers ecstatic and ultimately increase revenues.

## What Are the Best Practices for Creating Professional Product Documentation?

![What Are the Best Practices for Creating Professional Product Documentation?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_PAtUEFouRAqhgcvnJ/809d42be-d04c-76b1-7895-4348b612a22dbrooke_cagle__uhvrvdr7pg_unsplash1.jpg)

These best practices create aesthetically pleasing, informative, and easy-to-use product documentation. Following these guidelines will help you deliver product documentation that can make a good customer into a great customer. And great customers ultimately help companies increase revenues, with product documentation being a vital component of the customer experience.

### 1. Understand your target audience and give them what they want

It is essential to [know what your audience's expectations are](https://www.stickyminds.com/article/writing-requirements-documentation-multiple-audiences). For example, is the product documentation intended for Administrators or End Users? The scope of your target audience may require writing technically for Administrators or in clearly defined terms and instructions for the End User.

A best practice for creating professional product documentation is understanding customer expectations at the Administrator or End User level. Some of the methods to collect identifying audience information are:

* Questionnaires and Surveys

* Perceived audience feedback

* Company brainstorming

* Feedback on popular customer opinions

* Customer roundtable discussions

### 2. Create a documentation plan as a best practice

![Create a documentation plan as a best practice](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_OpuMo68fDe86GImec/3a718347-9b9e-c209-a4ca-c923253bf756kaleidico_26mjgncm0wc_unsplash.jpg)

Writing a documentation plan can help vision any potential bottlenecks during the project implementation. Creating product documentation can be challenging, and a best practice is to create a documentation plan to help foresee issues that can pop up during the documentation process.

Among the benefits of creating a documentation plan are the following:

* **Actionable items **- Auditing any existing documentation to **salvage applicable information** that can be reused with the new product documentation plan.

* **Observe templates and style guides** - If the product documentation is for a new product, make sure it stays within the voice and style of the industry, or if the documentation pertains to an existing product, maintain the current style guides and templates to **ensure the continuity of the brand**.

* **Document process tooling** - Document tooling can define and streamline the product documentation process while ensuring teamwork continuity and a better understanding of the document development process.

### 3. Simplify product documentation as a best practice

A study was conducted in 2016 to determine how many users read the product documentation. The results were eye-opening as they discovered only [25% of users do not read the product documentation.](https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/28/1/27/2363584?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) The survey found the lack of end users not reading product documentation is in part due to the following:

* **Users are impatient** - With the advent of immediate information via the web, users typically become less patient in discovering answers to their problems. Reading product documentation online or offline can be laborious due to the copious amounts of information required for a particular product.

* **Skip-ahead syndrome** - Users often skip over necessary product documentation straight to the basics of how to use the product. Users learn and understand how products work through interaction with the product rather than reading detailed instructions. Instructions must be as clear and informative as possible.

* **Confusing layout and structure **- Manuals are often written in a format that is difficult to understand and follow. Many users find the product documentation confusing or irrelevant to their question, becoming frustrated and discouraged from reading the manual. Often, the company did not conduct detailed audience research and not correctly understand what the user needed, and became too confused to finish reading.

### 4. Include screenshots and graphical information

Think of product documentation as a road map telling a story about a product. Lead the customer down a path easily i[dentified with screenshots or other graphics](https://theideanest.ca/5-types-graphics/?doing_wp_cron=1666462401.5462460517883300781250) and how each different graphic interacts with the other. Explain clearly what the user is looking at or when a feature is activated, how it reacts to the product, and what to expect next. Make sure each graphic is purposeful and that the product's workflow works with each other.

### 5. Use cross-links for a more precise understanding of topics.

I have found [cross-links to be invaluable when reading product documentation.](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/main/en-us/WritingReST/Reference/Content/Links.html) Understanding what a feature or function process does, helps immensely to cross-link to an associated topic. In addition, by cross-linking associated data points, the overall picture becomes more apparent regarding how the system interacts and workflow.

### 6. Remember the KISS principle for product documentation.

Remember to use the [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle when creating documentation](https://www.wrike.com/blog/understanding-kiss-principles-project-management/#What-does-KISS-stand-for). However, it is important to thoroughly document the process but not to the point of documentation overkill. In addition, the documentation user may be looking for certain information on specific items, so adhering to the KISS principle permits much easier navigation and understanding of the documentation.

For example, simple notations may suffice to explain a function, perhaps with a reference (cross-link) to the main subject. Keep the facts clean and not over-stated, so the user can easily search for information relevant to their needs. They may not be interested in reading every aspect of the product.

### 7. Accommodate different styles of learning

![Accommodate different styles of learning](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_uCmkZTtLD7r6Elyg2/b2bb8ece-a1f8-5df4-d5ed-f4392f04d374radek_grzybowski_ebrtyyjwpry_unsplash.jpg)

Each person has a [different style of learning](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/social-work/people-learn-in-different-ways.php). Some prefer in-depth descriptions, while others may prefer graphics and visual representations. However, some users learn more through hands-on involvement rather than focused reading.

Ensure to encompass all learning styles when creating effective and informative product documentation. For example, inserting graphics like screenshots, graphs, structured text, or video links helps ensure all learning styles understand the product documentation.

### 8. Personalize and structure onboarding content

Personalize the product [documentation based on the role of the audience](https://www.deanhouston.com/news/knowing-audience-document-right-document/). Create different versions of the documentation based on the roles of the intended audience when onboarding the content. For example, an administrator's questions may not be relevant to a power user's questions about the documentation.

Documentation can introduce a layer of personalization by creating slightly different versions of the document targeted more to the role of the intended audience. Modifying the onboarding content based on the role of the audience gives the documentation an element of personalization.

### 9. Clearly define terms for specific audiences

Depending on the intended audience, it is a good practice to explain the meaning of each term used throughout the documentation. You can use more complex terms with some clarification if the audience is internal. However, when external users access documentation, there is no way to know the expertise of the users.

Clearly defining unique or complex terms establishes much better and more efficient communications for all internal stakeholders and external users.

### 10. Provide a method to collect user feedback

Documentation feedback provides powerful information as to the document's effectiveness. Provide a link or a simple button with ""Like/Dislike"" to collect valuable information about the quality of the documentation. By [collecting user feedback,](https://www.k15t.com/rock-the-docs/documentation-guide/collaborative-writing/collect-user-feedback) the documentation can be refined and improved.

### 11 Avoid documentation with a flat structure

When creating product documentation, make sure the documentation is not written as a ""flat structure."" Reading a document full of flat text is laborious, and it can also become tedious. In addition, the reader's interest in the documentation will be heightened if the information is relevant to the discussed topic, and a reader can quickly consume it.

Break up the continuous, flat text by highlighting selected information or integrating videos, images, links, and other methods to provide a better UX. In addition, by delivering document content in ""bite-size"" chunks, the reader will have a more enjoyable experience and be less reluctant to read the documentation.

### 12. Create documentation that is SEO friendly

![Create documentation that is SEO friendly](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_JcQwSJ6c9VBPNDxiB/fc593084-5b7f-a9c5-63e1-9b310b83d086nisonco_pr_and_seo_yirdur6hivq_unsplash.jpg)

An online product documentation best practice is to make sure it is written in a style that is [documentation SEO-friendly](https://www.pragm.co/post/making-your-documentation-seo-friendly). Ensuring the documentation is written to maximize search results across the internet for your documentation. Clients may need to search for their documentation, and when they do not have the explicit link to the hosting site, by entering search terms, the responses are quicker and more concise when SEO friendly.

### 13. Keep the product documentation up to date

Maintaining product documentation maintenance is crucial, primarily if accessed online. Often, the requirements of a product change and the online documentation must reflect any new changes or updates. Therefore, user documentation needs to be current and refreshed for any recent updates and ensure the customer is notified and aware of changes in the product documentation.

### 14. Understand that users may not read the product documentation

A[ 2014 study found that users did not completely read](https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/28/1/27/2363584?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) all of the product documentation. The primary reasons for not reading the documentation were:

* Product documentation was overly complex

* Documentation did not directly address their questions

* Users did not use many features of the product due to not reading the documentation

* Rather than reading documentation, many users preferred ""hands-on"" learning

### 15. Manage both dynamic and static content

![Manage both dynamic and static content](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_OgArkokVN075yERo3/b97f1b98-62a4-5b80-5e15-a008439ad625shubham_dhage_hatkch_piqm_unsplash.jpg)

Product documentation continually evolves with updates, new features, corrected content, updated maintenance alerts, and other items. This update is considered a living, breathing document that is continually evolving to the product's requirements.

Static content provides the user with data that does not change across the product's life. The idea for static content is to give references to users, especially new users, information that remains static over the product's life cycle. Static content is vital to rich documentation but typically takes the back seat to dynamic documentation.

Maintaining the documentation set is easier when content is [classified as either dynamic or static](https://brainly.com/question/24688083). The product lifecycle documentation can be implemented and validated easier when documentation is categorized as dynamic or static. There may be minor changes in the documentation for new feature updates (static) or detailed product updates (dynamic).

### 16. Best practices for product documentation availability

Although users may not necessarily read much product documentation, when they need it, they want it immediately. The traditional delivery method for documentation was to have a printed manual that traveled with the product. However, in today's digital, online world, documentation is often delivered via the web.

Regardless of how product documentation is being delivered, it is essential to have readily available access points. Therefore, the predominate methods of providing documentation today are:

* **Offline documentation** - Many products are packaged with printed manuals or ""Quick Start"" shortcut sheets. These documents are usually ""one-offs"" and are not easily distributed. However, many manuals are optionally provided in an encapsulated PDF format, promoting portability or the option to print out on demand.

* **Online documentation**- Each time you search on Google for an answer to a problem, you probably are grabbing a snippet of online documentation. The advent of the web has supplanted printing manuals or product documentation materials for end users. Some of the benefits of online documentation are:

1. Teleworking - One thing the pandemic taught us is working from home can be productive as the office, especially when our questions are answered with online documentation.

2. Collaboration - With a readily accessible online documentation portal, team members can share information on the fly and create teamwork, which is often impossible at the office.

3. Mobile friendly - The advent of mobile devices such as iPads and smartphones has slowly supplanted PCs for day-to-day interactions. You can easily access online documentation with a smartphone, and any nagging product issues can be readily researched, even at your favorite cafe during lunch.

1/7/2023 22:27:03,Tal F.,"At Docsie, we bring the power of versatile documentation tools to you. Companies can innovate in the central process of delivering information to every stakeholder in a very particular way – so that new initiatives and products get the visibility that they need, and everyone is on the same page.

### Organization And Visual Dashboard Designs

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_KcRBWUiCJ0UoEUOKC/f86c49a8-1b13-5d38-2fbe-f671f02cfaecmaxim_ilyahov_blf4r69ltgw_unsplash.jpg)

The Docsie platform works on the principle of pushing product documentation and content to its end user environments in a centralized and organized way. So much of today's software development world is built around this kind of visual dashboard approach, where it's the format and the intuitive interface that matter most.

With a great cloud hosted interface, it's easy to unify your product documentation, tackle the learning curve, and publish your content to the web – seamlessly and effortlessly. That cloud model is very useful – that’s why cloud services took over twenty-first century business so fully and quickly. But it has to be set up right!

### Virtual Books and Virtual Shelves

Here's another component of that virtual organization that drives [Docsie’s](https://www.docsie.io/) product documentation processes.

Within our interface, you'll see [virtual shelves holding discrete numbers of virtual books](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/using-docsie/?doc=/using-docsie-library/moving-and-copying-documents/) that contain your content and documentation, and the tools to move items with key automations.

This [object-driven mentality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300921) is part of how we help our clients to onboard staff quickly and efficiently, with the system that everyone can learn to use confidently. You could think of it as the “Github for documentation” – in many ways, it’s that same process of building a context for information that is popular, easy to understand, and then universally adopted.

### Collaborative Tools


![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_9A6GNIUeIDG1bUZID/bf6dc944-2db5-e845-f946-37c7e99ee813marvin_meyer_syto3xs06fu_unsplash.jpg)

In any content process, there are usually multiple stakeholders – people and parties working together to get the right information to the right destination.

That's also a huge part of how Docsie works, and how we have thoughtfully designed the platform to deliver. Through the documentation workflow processes in our model, it becomes easier to see what each participant is doing within a collaborative pipeline.

Publishing Automations Make Content Portable

Essentially, the[ JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) automations that we built Docsie on are an example of how API documentation tools and related resources work to allow clients to publish anywhere, instead of being confined to one isolated Wordpress silo or other shuttered destination. That versatility is at the core of how a unified documentation and content system releases its goods to the world – how you move things from drafts or beta into the full production phase.

Want to learn more about Docsie? Try one of our demos, or reach out to a friendly technician to get more information on what this type of platform can do for your business. You’ll see that principle of transparency and frictionless documentation workflows at work, helping adopters to drive efficiencies and outpace the competition.

1/7/2023 22:30:06,Tal F.,"Technical writing is one of the mind-boggling jobs out there, as the writer has to elucidate hi-tech information in an understandable and clear manner to the audience.

The technical posts shouldn’t be too complicated to grasp, drawn out, or grammatically incorrect. And sometimes, it is quite a tedious job to find good technical guides that are simple and clear to read.

Your technical writing can be in any form, such as

* An instruction or user manual

* Training course book

* Product descriptions

* Whitepapers

* Product manuals

* Reference guides

* Annual reports, and much more

In this rapidly evolving digital era, technical writers must leverage certain strategies to accomplish the true engagement of readers. Indeed, it is a huge challenge!

Hence, in this post, we will provide you with some amazing tips and tricks to engage your readers when writing technical guides:

If you are looking to hire a technical writer or are technical writer looking for remote work, see [Technical writer jobs available on Jooble](https://jooble.org/jobs-technical-writer-remote).

## Main objectives of a Technical Writer

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_K9C0MKI3LgOVvRHIC/56aae035-c94c-f464-32cc-f7811ec34cdeimage.jpg)

### 1. Know the Audience

Analyze the target audience and accordingly, the technical writers must decide the style, tone, length, and format of their writing.

Without knowing the persona of your audience, you may end up writing too simple or overly complicated technical posts. And, we don’t want to do that.

One must try to strike a perfect balance between insightful, knowledgeable, and understandable delivery of information.

### 2. Readability

Readability is one of the key factors to engage your technical readers, as the readability score is what decides how accessible your post really is. Readers must not find it hard to navigate through your technical guide or grasp the level of language used.

Writers must try to inculcate user-friendly language with optimal style and format that’s informative yet simple.

### 3. Accuracy

Statistics, facts, and claims in the document must always be cross-checked and backed by evidence or study reports cited from reliable sources. Otherwise, the information provided may lose its authenticity and reliability in the public.

To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the tech writer must leverage the following strategies:

* Convey the technical information in a simple, crystal clear manner, such that even a non-technical audience can understand it.

* Use techniques and tools that hone the technical content provided.

* Effectively lay out the technical suggestions, ideas, notions, views, and observations in a strategic sequence.

* Use the right tone of vocabulary with a precise structure to illustrate reports, documents, or presentations.

## 12 Best Tips to apply when writing a Technical Guide to Engage your Readers

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_CDo3jPQUeYxiW9peG/e2f448b6-580d-4a86-4cca-f34aaea0a88eimage.jpg)

### 1. Analyze the expertise of your audience

Technical guides must be informative and insightful. When writing such content, the writer needs to analyze how much the audience already knows about the technical notions related to the topic.

There’s no need to interpret subjects that your audience is already well-versed with. By the same token, it isn’t logical to skip notions that your audience may not have a basic understanding of. Both ways, your audience is likely to lose interest or find your tech guide either too complex or unnecessarily long-winded.

The key here is to analyze the foundational knowledge and capabilities of your audience and then provide them with the information that’ll build a solid foundation about the subject and be educational at the same time.

### 2. Deep Research

Writing technical content calls for comprehensive research and accurate piece of information backed with correct statistics or facts. This is what gives weight and value to your technical content; hence it is the most crucial factor to engage your readers.

Execute detailed analysis of the context and technical information, such as:

* Gathering information related to all the technical aspects of the subject including scope, features, design process, specifications, legal frameworks, etc.

* Study legal contracts and their requirements. The technical content must comply with the regulatory standards that are applicable. Hence, make sure to keep up with the legal requirements.

* Analyze the target audience and tailor your content as per the understanding and requirements of your target group of users. This includes various aspects such as graphics, level of language, output media type, readability, complexity level, etc.

### 3. Structure of representation

When imparting technical knowledge in the form of guides or manuals, the structure and format play a vital role.

Technical guides are as it is a bit complex to understand; hence you don’t want to inculcate more complexities in the structure. Developing engagement with such content becomes difficult.

To deliver value to your audience, the writer must consider how to structure the content the way they would like to engage with it.

### 4. Visuals and Graphics

Using tech-related images that are visually attractive yet informative will not only tactically break the content but also engage your readers.

The attention span of present-day readers seems to be short. Hence, a technical guide with images will make your content easier to navigate, and flowy and help you break lengthy blocks of text.

Likewise, don’t go overboard with too many images as it may overshadow your actual technical information. Try to strike a good balance between text and visual representation.

### 5. Examples are imperative

Examples have the potential to make complex topics easier to understand. Elucidate a real-time scenario that resonates with the topic in the picture to make your audience understands it more effectively. Tech writers could even use imagery as an example and then explain it.

### 6. Voice it correctly

Oftentimes, a technical guide can sound mundane with a neutral tone, which shouldn’t be the case. Your technical guide must have a voice of its own, and one of the best ways to inculcate this is by using a first-person perspective.

When writing in first-person, make sure to still keep an authoritative and professional approach.

### 7. Use simple language throughout

Technical writing isn’t supposed to be complicated, just because it covers hi-tech topics. When trying to determine technical concepts, processes, or methods, try to keep up with the technical creativity without overcomplicating things.

One of the most common culprits to disastrous writing is not considering the fact that readers may not be well-versed with certain concepts. With this, it is very likely that your audience will feel confused, unaccommodating, and less involved.

Simple Technical English (STE) standards will enhance the translatability and readability of your document.

Try to write a technical guide with the use of the following rules:

* Simple sentence structure

* Active voice

* Consistent terms

* Simple verb tenses

In other words, try to keep it simple and short.

### 8. Clarify the hook

Right at the beginning of your technical guide, define the hook of your content viz. the things readers will learn from your guide. Quickly outline the technical content and explain all areas your article is going to cover, so your readers will know what to expect.

Doing this will ensure your readers feel satisfied and fulfilled once they end up reading the entire guide. Nobody wants to read an entire block of content only to realize at the end that it is not the piece of information they’re looking for.

### 9. Layout is essential

The layout is one of the effective ways to make your technical content more engaging and readable, whilst focusing on key areas.

Make strategic use of page breaks, bulleted points, numbered lists, keywords in bold, and tables to highlight significant points and draw attention to the right sections.

### 10. Avoid referring to a specific time period

To keep your technical content valid for a long period of time, make sure you do not refer to a specific year such as “In 2021” or “this year”. Using these phrases will restrict and date your content to a specific time period, and reduce its validity over the long haul.

Proof your content for the future by not using a time-sensitive reference; rather try to make it general.

### 11. Make it witty

Even if it is technical content, try to add some humor or wittiness to make it lightweight. This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to hook your audience.

### 12. Review your tech document

It is always a smart step to review your technical documentation once from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to validate your content. This will not only provide you with invaluable insights but also make it free from grammatical errors.

![Notion and Coda ](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_K8EhYKmEzzXLlzyED/464be919-c7e6-ee02-2712-4199de0eb4fc4.png)

The difference is that Coda starts working slowly when dealing with large documents. And Notion flows more naturally when writing since it started as a note-taking tool.

Meanwhile, Docsie is more like a WordPress editor — with a more intuitive user experience. Like Notion and Coda, it also gives you all the editing functionality you need but focuses more on ease of use with features like shortcuts.

![WordPress editor](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_QLNiJSTmyFVr34Hpw/dcb6f484-1df4-27ca-62c4-bb02c74f4f525.png)

**Docsie has the best sharing & client access**

Notion and Coda both let you manage access internally by assigning roles with admin tools, or externally by sharing them on the internet.

Docsie uses a similar system but also lets you password-protect pages and share articles with readers on knowledge portals or website embeds.

**Coda has minimal version control, Notion shows change history, and Docsie has rollback and access permissions**

Coda offers minimal version control, which can’t help with questions like ""when was the last time this page changed?"" or ""what changed?""

Notion provides change history with the enterprise plan, but it allows only rollbacks, so it works more like a backup than actual version control.

Meanwhile, **Docsie has powerful version control features.**

Instead of rollbacks, all of your previous article versions are available in the book. You can designate one as the “current version” and decide if you want to show old versions to users. That means you have complete control of what you show to your readers and how you version your documents.

**Docsie has powerful content embeds**

Another difference between Coda, Notion, and Docsie is that Docsie allows [19 content embeds](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/docsie-integrations/?doc=/content-embeds/google-forms-in-docsie/&v=2.0.0&ln=en) that work seamlessly in your articles. That means you can use the full functionality of apps like Google Sheets, Google Docs, Loom, Google Maps, GitHub Gists, and many more.

**Winner:** [**Docsie**](https://www.docsie.io/). It’s the perfect blend of features and ease of use to create beautiful digital documentation.

![Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ijClMNPejkT6AcQlq/3cff1420-b57a-6a94-c90f-d718f52f61856.png)

## Notion vs Coda vs Docsie: Knowledge Management

**Docsie has all you need in one package, Notion and Coda are customizable but can get complex**

**Docsie has an intuitive organization structure, while Coda and Notion let you create your own**

![Coda and Notion](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_WRgZM09XbYbBphN3g/b1cb0869-6f67-3a9e-0d4d-833833ed56faimage.png)

Docsie uses an intuitive knowledge organization structure.

It uses “shelves” that contain “books”, which can be organized into “sections”. The books contain articles, previous versions, and articles in other languages.

**Docsie works just like a library, and it’s easy to understand.**


![Docsie 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_taaK2xC3oGVlfbB6u/d5272e81-1fcf-649b-0943-f68f125596407.png)

Coda and Notion, on the other hand, rely on nested pages. It’s intuitive and you can create any structure you want. But it can get confusing quickly if you’re nesting subpages more than 3 layers deep.

**Coda’s search is clunky, Docsie and Notion easily surface the right information**

Large organizations often have problems finding data in Coda. Its search isn’t as advanced as Notion’s or Docsie’s because it doesn’t surface pages as results, only data.

Meanwhile, Notion and Docsie are more user-friendly because they search across pages and all data. Docsie also lets you filter articles by language.

**Winner:** **Do[csie**](https://www.docsie.io/), since it uses a very intuitive & scalable organization structure and a powerful search that lets you navigate your documents quickly.

## Notion vs Docsie vs Coda: Pricing & Value for money

**Notion offers best value for money, Docsie is most affordable for knowledge management, Coda is pricey**

![Docsie being affordable for knowledge management](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_ToSMUdd9b8bQxXq6O/769d7d69-0a9d-1c93-23d3-d2824a986423image.png)

### Free plan comparison

**Coda** offers a free plan for an unlimited number of team members. The number of table rows is limited to 1000 across all your tables. The number of objects in the doc is also limited to 50. Objects include pages, tables, views, buttons, controls, and Formulas. So if you want to manage a team with Coda, you’ll quickly exceed the free pricing plan limits.

**Notion**’s free plan doesn’t limit the number of blocks you can use, but it’s made for only one person. You can add 5 guests, but you can’t manage access for them.

**Docsie** has a free plan for up to 3 accounts and you get to show your documents to unlimited guests. But it has a file upload limit and you can manage 5 books and 1 shelf (though with unlimited articles).

### Paid plan price comparison

**On the paid plan, every app lets you share documents with guests for free.** So prices essentially depend on how many team members have editing access.

[**Coda**](https://coda.io/pricing) charges $10/month/user for the “Pro” and $30/month/user for the “Team” plan.

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/pricing) charges $4/month/user for the “Personal Pro” and $8/month/user for the “Team” plan.

[**Docsie**](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/) has three flat-fee pricing plans based on team size and features.


![Personal Pro](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_c5RDZVCv35TAPYDrP/7d646eed-dd46-d9ca-3fb2-3edac01eaefcimage.png)

**What to go with if the price is your biggest concern**

**Go with Notion if:**

* You’re only looking for a free personal productivity platform. (Free plan)

* You want to provide your team with powerful personal workspaces, but don’t need strong collaboration tools. (Personal Pro plan)

* You need an all-in-one workspace with over 25 members (Team plan)

**Go with Docsie if:**

* You need a collaborative platform with up to 15 editors (Startup Plus/Small Team plans)

* You’re a team of any size that needs a specialized app for knowledge base/SOP management — Docsie isn’t much more expensive than Notion but it has better features for these use cases

**Go with Coda if:**

* You need a team workspace with more database/automation features than Notion

* The lack of key knowledge base management features and high price aren’t problems for you

**Winner**: Either **Do[csie**](https://www.docsie.io/) or **No[tion**](https://www.notion.so/). If you need a dedicated SOP knowledge base, go with Docsie. If you need a general productivity workspace, go with Notion.

## Coda vs Docsie vs Notion: Customer Support

**Coda and Docsie have the best customer support, while Notion is still catching up**

![Coda and Docsie](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_cCccYMWpvSFtStVar/5515627e-1c86-1910-d840-530861b6e3e1image.png)

Customer support is tough to judge.

It wouldn’t be fair to base it on a single experience. So we’ve gone over the latest reviews and opinions on Reddit, G2, and Capterra to compare the three based on what users say.

**Notion’s customer support is still catching up**

Notion used to rely on its community for support.

It only started investing in a proper support team recently. Users say their support doesn’t provide good technical help, and quickly sends you to engineers for such issues. And engineers usually say they’ll fix it in the next version.

![Coda and Docsie Image 1](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Zc6no9VdccJBm78Q1/badb84b7-f421-feec-f6a5-b0cc60e4e4518.jpg)

**Coda has great customer support**

[Many Coda users](https://www.g2.com/products/coda-coda/reviews?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters%5Bkeyphrases%5D=support%20team&order=g2_default&filters%5Bcomment_answer_values%5D=) praise their support team for the fast response times and how easy it is to work with.

**Docsie’s customer support is “professional, responsive and well organized”**

Our team is always ready to help if you encounter any issues with Docsie. But it’s best if you take it directly [from our users](https://www.g2.com/products/docsie/reviews?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters%5Bcomment_answer_values%5D=&filters%5Bkeyphrases%5D=customer%20support&order=g2_default):

**Winner:** [Coda](https://coda.io/) and [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/): for their quick (technical) support.

## Coda vs Notion vs Docsie: Database Features
**Coda is most powerful, Notion is for visualization, and Docsie allows you to embed Google Sheets**

![Docsie-Coda](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_13TNnIbQ7OYsubsAI/54dd4e37-3864-a62f-2859-fefca1ed835eimage.png)

**Notion is the king of visualization…**

Notion’s table capabilities are extensive. You can create different “views” like

* List,

* Table,

* Board,

* Gallery,

* Calendar,

* And timeline.

You make them by creating a new page with the selected view. Then you can also embed them on other pages.

**But Coda’s functions are wa*y b*etter than Notion’s**

Coda has similar database features as Notion.

But it also has conditional formatting and calculations, making it as robust as Google Sheets.

![Notion](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Lx9cKNSIm8lNlGA9H/1bebbbb3-8e7f-72d1-17aa-a06945e3edaf14.jpg)

On top of that Coda has integrated functions that remind of a true programming language. If you're tech-savvy, they'll feel intuitive and easy. And you can add them *anywhere*, not just in tables.

![Coda Integration functions](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_Voln5A5F6XDlzUZkl/76b858e2-6310-dffb-46c7-f0825f41e78415.jpg)

For example, here’s something that’s trivial to do in Coda but a huge pain in Notion: If I want to count the number of rows in a spreadsheet with Status matching ""TODO"".

In Coda, this is as trivial as creating a formula: =MyTable.CountIf(Status=""TODO""). In Notion, you would have to create a new related database, link elements together, add a rollup field containing label text then use a convoluted formula like length(replaceAll(replaceAll(prop(""Status""), ""TODO"", ""*""), ""[\^*]"", """"))).

**Docsie lets you embed Google Sheets**

Docsie allows the creation of spreadsheets much like Notion, but it doesn’t allow as many different views in its editor, nor does it have powerful functions like Coda. However, the workaround is that Docise allows Google Sheets embeds, with their full functionality.

**Winner:** **[Coda**](https://coda.io/) for power users that want to replace Google Sheets.

## Notion vs Coda vs Docsie: Apps And Integrations

**Coda offers more native integrations than Notion, Docsie focuses on knowledge base functionality**

![Docsie Functionality](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_JLDSpWBDcIaMWR3Ce/file_oMD9vlGvaPuY0cOtt/dd0aabe5-3e88-3177-8aa5-e89322d4f6f3image.png)

Coda is the best option if you need integrations across many apps. It offers *o[ver 300 native integrations*](https://coda.io/gallery?page=11&filter=packs), making it impossible not to integrate with your tech stack. Notion, on the other hand, focuses only on the essentials with its [36 native integrations](https://www.notion.so/integrations/all).

**Docsie Approaches App Integrations Differently Than Notion Or Coda**

Docsie’s motto is “knowledge base functionality first” allowing you to directly [embed other apps’ content](https://portals.docsie.io/docsie/docsie-documentation/docsie-integrations/?doc=/content-embeds/&v=2.0.0&ln=en) into your articles. For example, it allows you to edit Google Docs directly on your knowledge portals, without having to open another browser tab or app.

Docsie also has native integration with **GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Zapier** — so it’s easily integrable with your business processes.

**Winner: [Coda**](https://coda.io/), because of the sheer quantity of native integrations.

7/7/2023 11:14:02,Tanya A Mishra,"In today's dynamic world of web development, a new game-changing feature known as webhooks is changing how applications interact. Imagine triggering actions in one application immediately whenever specific events happen in another. 

That's what webhooks are for! These digital messengers enable real-time communication between web applications and deliver unparalleled speed. 

This blog post will explore webhooks' essential role in modern web development. We intend to investigate their importance and application, especially in the context of the new Docsie features. Whether you're an experienced developer or new to the tech landscape, this comprehensive guide aims to thoroughly understand webhooks and how they can supercharge your web applications.

### Understanding webhooks 

1. **Definition and Application **

Webhooks are a relatively new concept in web development, acting as a bridge between web applications. A web browser is like a digital messenger that notifies one application of specific events in another. **Instead of actively querying data, webhooks enable you to instantly ""push"" information from one application to another as soon as a default event occurs. **

Imagine receiving a notification on your phone when a friend texts you. That's the power of webhooks - instantaneous and real-time communication between applications. 

1. **The role of real-time communication**

Webhooks are essential in organising seamless, real-time verbal exchange among applications. When an event is triggered in the supplied software, consisting of growing a brand new file or updating an editorial, the internet browser sends a message of relevant information to a predefined URL within the utility they're constructed on.

This immediate record change allows applications to respond to events, allowing builders to automate actions and provide real-time updates. Whether for notifying crew members of report changes or connecting to external systems, the webhook offers the spine for instant and active conversation.

When an event is induced within the supply utility, it sends a webhook request with event statistics to the calling page URL of the target utility. The target application then processes the payload and performs a described operation based on the received statistics.

Essentially, webhooks are a powerful tool that allows event-driven workflows, provides actual-time communication and automation, and opens up a world of possibilities in modern internet development.

1. **Key features of Webhook **

Webhooks have several key features that offer seamless communication between packages. Let's delve into each item and understand what it means:

**Payload: **The payload is the heart of the webhook and sends the specified information from the source application to the target utility. It usually contains information in some form, along with JSON or XML, and contextual facts about the event that triggered the webhook. 

**For instance**, when a new file is created within the supplied software, the payload can also encompass the file name, content, writer, and creation timestamp.

**Event Triggers: **Event triggers are particular moves or activities in the supply application that cause a webhook. Webhooks are designed to reply to predefined occasions, including developing documents, deleting new entries, or making adjustments to the machine. Each event trigger corresponds to a particular movement in the goal utility.

**Callback URLs:** The callback URL is the endpoint within the goal software wherein the payload is sent when the webhook is about. Once the payload is received utilising the target software, it can technique the records and take basic movements. 

The callback URL acts as the client's coping mechanism, ensuring the message reaches its intended vacation spot. Let us seek advice from the following desk to outline the intervals:

|Component|Description|
|-|-|
|Payload|Carries data from the source application to the target application, containing event-specific information.|
|Event Triggers|Specific actions or occurrences within the source application that initiate the webhook.|
|Callback URLs|The endpoint in the target application where the payload is sent allows data processing and action execution.|
Understanding these features is essential to configure webhooks and preserve clear conversations between programmes. 

* **Webhooks and APIs **

**Explanation of the difference **

Webhooks and APIs are essential tools in modern network improvement, but they vary in how they speak and facilitate data exchange.

**Webhooks are designed for server-to-server verbal exchange and comply with an event-driven method. **Those applications can push facts to any other software without considering a selected request. Whenever an event is precipitated in the source software, the webhook sends a message to the default URL inside the target application, which sends occasion-specific records. Webhooks work particularly well in real-time, providing on-the-spot updates and automating moves as events occur.

**On the other hand, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are designed for consumer-server verbal exchange. **They are carried out through an express request that a client application sends to the server. The customer requests precise records or actions, and the server responds to the requested documents.

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_F7W3rTqgrYeAVpKRo/image2.jpg)

### Highlighting the value of event-driven conditions

The advantages of webhooks shine brightest in occasion-driven environments where the immediate reaction to events is essential. Unlike APIs, which require clients to search for new facts continuously, **webhooks eliminate the need for frequent queries.** This capability reduces useless server load and data sharing, making the webhook perfect for actual-time packages, inclusive of chat notifications, live updates, and IoT (Internet of Things) integration.

### Comparative Chart: Webhooks vs APIs

To visually draw attention to the differences between webhooks and APIs, let's take a look at the following comparative chart:

|Aspect|Webhooks|APIs|
|-|-|-|
|Communication|Server-to-server (Push-based)|Client-server (Request-based)|
|Data Exchange|Event-driven, real-time updates|Explicit client requests|
|Polling|Not required|Frequent polling may be needed|
|Efficiency|Immediate response to events|Response time depends on the request|
|Suitable Scenarios|Real-time updates, chat notifications, IoT|Data retrieval, client interactions|
**In summary, the webhook excels in event-related situations, presenting instantaneous conversation and eliminating the need for ongoing balloting. **On the other hand, APIs are ideally suited for clear patron-server communication and fact retrieval. Webhooks and APIs have particular strengths and weaknesses; their differences allow builders to select the best tool for their needs.

There are other remarkable features like real-time editing, commenting and version control. Through these features, you can reduce miscommunication amongst your team members, increase productivity and reduce time and effort considerably. 

HATs are great tools that keep team members well-knitted in a close group. One of the noteworthy features of HATs includes track changes. This lets users switch between various versions of the same document, creating comprehensive and well-documented content irrespective of what topic you're working on.  

Moreover, you can use elements like videos, animations, and interactive simulations to improve the learning experience for you teams or customers by using HAT tools. 

### 5. Publishing and Maintenance:

Updating and maintaining documentation regularly is a tiring process. To ease things for its users, a HAT lets writers make changes to the preliminary source file following which updates are made to all the file formats. This ensures that all users remain up to date regarding the changes that are made and can access the final version of the file without any hassle. 

In the case of publishing, HATs often provide templates so that technical authors can work on the already existing base-level formatting. The templates also suggest various kinds of visual layouts, making it easier for technical writers to pull videos, motion graphics, videos, etc. from other sources.

8/23/2023 9:57:09,Tanya A Mishra,"Did you know that today, [65 percent ](https://csa-research.com/Blogs-Events/CSA-in-the-Media/Press-Releases/Consumers-Prefer-their-Own-Language)of customers prefer content in their native language? And 40 percent of customers would not order a product from a website in a language other than their own. As businesses expand into new regions, it is more important than ever that their technical manuals be translated into several languages so that they can explain their services to users in a better way to cater to a global audience. 

Eliminating language barriers improves non-native buyers journey and customer satisfaction on a web platform, improving global reach. However, in the past, this took time and effort to do. Thankfully, a game-changing answer in the form of AI translations has appeared. Because of this breakthrough, translation focused on the target audience is now easier, quicker, and cheaper than ever before, as businesses do not need need to guzzle cash for hiring native speakers or linguists.

## Conventional Methods of Analysis

Previously, all manual translation work had to be done by human translators who had to deal with a long set of instructions with their linguistic skills and common standards. However, there were difficulties with the technical jargon. Consider how hard it is to express complex ideas to someone who needs to learn about the topic. As mistakes were fixed and precision was maintained, this usually led to longer wait times and higher costs.

### What Does the Rise of AI will Mean for the Translation Industry?

According to a study, the AI translation market, by 2030 is projected to be worth[ $7.5 billion](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/machine-translation-market-size), as businesses try to expand their horizons by tapping global markets and international customers. This growth directly results from the rising demand for AI-driven translation tools that are helping customers around the world. 

The field of translation is already seeing the effects of artificial intelligence. Imagine a day when computers are so advanced that they can instantly convert text between any two languages they know. With the help of AI, this can now be done without any human intervention. This simplifies operations and ensures a cost-effective localisation process. Businesses no longer need as many in-house human translators as they formerly did and they can generate content in as many languages as they want without any technical education. This change may help keep expenses and increase output, making organizations more globally competitive. 

## Role of AI in Translation

There are several approaches that AI translation tools can use to translate text.

 **Machine learning**

[Training Machine Learning algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/much-training-data-required-machine-learning/) require massive amounts of data and code. This anthology has several parallel writings, which are pairs of phrases or paragraphs written in two languages but with the same meaning. Effective translation algorithms trained on the matched texts may employ the patterns they have learned to create their high-quality translations.

[Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-history-of-machine-translation-from-the-cold-war-to-deep-learning-f1d335ce8b5/)

**Statistical methods**

AI translation tools use several different statistical methods. In these processes, we use statistical analysis to determine the most likely translation of a given word or phrase. We understand the requirements of the clients before deploying the translation process.

 **Neural networks**

Machine learning algorithms called neural networks aim to mimic the operation of the human brain. Neural networks have promise for the transfer of complex information.

### How Can AI Be Used to Improve Technical Manual Translations?

AI translation tools may be trained on large parallel text datasets comprising pairings of terms in several languages with the same meaning. This might be useful for identifying and translating jargon and terminology. As a result, jargon and terminology may be translated using the tools. AI tools might use this to learn how to translate technical words properly. For instance, [Google ](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[Translate](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html)[ ](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html) NMT model was trained using a massive original and translated source code database. That implies that Google Translate can easily understand medical, legal, and engineering jargon.

AI translation tools may be trained to recognize the context of all things text. This allows them to convey the meaning of statements with several interpretations more effectively. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator), for example is an SMT tool that has been trained on a massive corpus of source code and translated texts. With this improvement, DeepL is better able to deal with sentences that might be translated in several ways based on the context of the text it is translating.

Tools driven by artificial intelligence might be trained to translate sentences in a natural tone. This is particularly important for technical manuals, which often use specialized terminology that might be difficult to translate. [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/)[ ](https://www.docsie.io/)is a hybrid solution to the translation issue since it draws from both statistical machine translation and neural machine translation.

**1. Human judgment:** When it comes to choosing the right words and phrases, AI is not always as good as humans. For example, **""set""** might be mistakenly rendered as ""**juego**"" in Spanish. The appropriate term is **""conjunto.""**

**2. Bias:**  The training data is crucial to the final product's quality. AI may develop a taste for that nation's culture and language if it is fed just books from that country.

**3. Security:**  There is a fear that putting sensitive information via an AI translator might compromise security. It is dangerous because private data might get into the wrong hands.

**4. Lack of cultural context:** AI may struggle to understand the cultural importance of a text, leading to inaccurate results. For example, if it translates ""to pull someone's leg"" (from English) to ""to pull someone's hair"" (from Spanish), that would make no sense in either the English or Spanish cultural contexts.

**5. Potential Idiomatic Challenges:** It is simple for artificial intelligence to translate words but may grapple with sentences whose meanings vary between languages. Idioms are idiomatic terms that can be challenging to comprehend literally due to their cultural connotations.


Using a hybrid system that combines [machine learning with human translators](https://hbr.org/2018/07/collaborative-intelligence-humans-and-ai-are-joining-forces) is one way to overcome AI's shortcomings when translating technical manuals. Human reviewers could catch and correct any mistakes made by AI translations, which could then handle the majority of the job. Technical manuals may be translated more precisely and consistently using this integrated method without losing subtlety in the target language or cultural context.

The methods of translation can be both time consuming and expensive. They often involve hiring translators, which can significantly impact your budget. Moreover, these translators might not possess industry knowledge. It may inadvertently introduce errors during the translation process.

By automating the translation process, [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/)[ ](https://www.docsie.io/)offers businesses an opportunity to reduce their translation costs. Making use of machine learning capabilities, Docsie ensures efficient translations, thereby saving businesses time and money.

* **Test with users** - Iteratively test guidance with actual users and observe their reactions and feedback.

* **Analyze data and optimize** - Use tools like analytics and session replays to see how guidance performs and identify improvements.

The goal is to deliver each educational or supportive experience at the moment it will be most useful. This requires understanding user workflows, predicting needs, and continually refining based on observed usage patterns. When timed appropriately, every guidance interaction can feel seamless rather than disruptive.

## What types of in-app guidance are most effective?

When designing in-app guidance, consider these most effective types of interactions:

* **Spotlight Cues -** Subtly highlight or animate specific buttons or UI elements to draw attention.

* **Tooltips** - Short contextual text that appears when hovering/tapping on part of the UI.

* **Coach Marks** - Overlays with porthole cutouts that focus on a specific UI element.

* **Checklists** - Help users complete multi-step workflows via checklists that adapt as tasks are accomplished.

* **Step-by-Step Walkthroughs** - Break complex tasks into numbered step-by-step instructions.

* **Interactive Tutorials** - Let users practice within the live app UI via highlights, overlays, and prompts.

* **Animated Demos** - Use animated demos of workflows and interactions for more visual learning.

* **In-App Notifications** - Send non-intrusive reminders, tips, and updates via notices.

* **Spot User Struggles** - Detect points of failure and proactively provide assistance to get users back on track.

* **Personalized Recommendations** - Suggest functionality and content based on the user's context and past behaviors.

* **On-Screen Microcopy** - Provide concise contextual text instructions within UI elements.

* **Object Detection** - In AR/VR, detect objects and overlay related information.

* **Video Demos** - Include links or embed short videos demonstrating workflows within relevant contexts.

* **Search Guidance** - Refine search behaviors via auto-complete and contextual recommendations.

The types of guidance should align with the complexity of the task and the user's level of experience. Well-timed, unobtrusive interactions layered on top of the existing UI tend to work better than immersive tutorials or wizards that take over the screen. Test with users and iterate to determine the right approaches.

## How can you make in-app guidance unintrusive?

There are a few best practices for making in-app guidance unintrusive:

* **Prioritize simplicity** - Avoid overwhelming users. Boil instructions down to the essential info needed.

* **Use subtle visuals** - Things like faint spotlights and thin tooltips tend to be less distracting.

* **Minimize text** - Use succinct micro-copy and avoid walls of help text.

* **Consider positioning** - Display guidance near related UI elements rather than as app-wide overlays.

* **Time it thoughtfully** - Pop up at natural breaks, not during active workflows.

* **Allow dismissal** - Let users easily dismiss guidance so it doesn't feel forced.

* **Limit frequency** - Don't oversaturate users with too much guidance too often.

* **Personalize when possible** - Tailor guidance based on known user attributes and contexts.

* **Use subtle animation** - Subtle pulsating or highlighting draws attention without distracting.

* **Test outside of context** - Make sure guidance components feel unobtrusive even when viewed alone.

* **Provide indicators** - Badges, step trackers, and progress bars add clarity about length.

* **Allow option to re-view** - Let users re-access guidance in case they miss something.

* **Avoid pop-overs** - Overlay pop-ups tend to be disruptive - consider more embedded approaches.

* **Focus on single tasks** - Target guidance to specific atomic tasks rather than lengthy workflows.

Well-designed, contextual guidance feels like a natural, seamless part of the user experience instead of an interruption. The right visual styling, content tone, timing, and brevity help guidance provide assistance without impeding user focus and flow. Evaluating with real users and iterating based on feedback is key.

## How do you measure the effectiveness of in-app guidance?

Evaluating the effectiveness of in-app guidance should involve both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback to get a complete picture.

* **Task success rate** - % of times users complete a task guided by the feature vs. unguided.

* **Task completion time** - How long it takes users to complete a task with vs. without guidance.

* **Error rate** - How often errors occur during a guided task compared to unguided.

* **Guidance engagement** - What % of users click, view, or interact with the guidance components.

* **Guidance re-views** - Frequency that users re-open or re-engage with guidance after initial viewing.

* **Net Promoter Score** - User satisfaction metric rated on a scale of willingness to recommend.

* **Churn or abandonment** - Whether guidance impacts user drop-off rates.

## Documentation Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

Documentation is an easy process that involves multiple steps. Here are all the exact steps to creating the perfect documentation:

**Step 1: Define Purpose and Audience**

To begin with, you need to define the purpose as well as the readers of the documentation. You need to consider if it is a user manual, technical reference, or project report as well as will need to give a thought about background, knowledge level, and expectations of readers before penning your content.

**Step 2: Choose Format**

You will then need to choose the right format of documentation for your readers and purpose. It can be either in a written format if the documentation's purpose is to provide detailed technical information. On the other hand, you could go with a video tutorial that can help viewers learn certain processes with ease.

**Step 3: Gather Information**

In this step, you will need to start sourcing all the necessary information that will make documentation helpful and insightful for the audience. Easiest way to do so is gathering all information in one place. This will help you prepare your documentation with ease and show your best work.

**Step 4: Plan and Write**

Create a proper outline of the documentation. Use easy-to-understand language while avoiding jargon. provide meanings of all technical words that you use in your documentation for easy understanding to readers.

**Step 5: Use Visual Aids, Examples**

You should mix your text with visual representation to provide a better presentation of the documentation to the end user. These visuals, which could be diagrams or charts, or illustrations for that matter, could improve the understanding of the audience.

**Step 6: Review and Edit**

Do a careful survey of your documentation for sentence structure, spelling, and accentuation mistakes. Check for consistency in designing, phrasing, and composing style.

**Step 7: Test and Collect Feedback (if applicable)**

Test any procedures or instructions in your documentation to make sure they are accurate and complete. Share the documentation with a gathering of expected readers to accumulate input on clarity and convenience.

**Step 8: Revise and Update**

In view of criticism and any progressions in the topic, make suitable corrections to the documentation. Keep your documentation current and pertinent to address developing requirements.

**Step 9: Publish and Distribute**

Distribute the documentation in the picked design, whether it's a printed manual, PDF, page, or video stage.

**Step 10: Provide Ongoing Support and Maintenance**

Set up a procedure for offering users who encounter documentation-related issues or questions ongoing support. Consistently survey and update the documentation to reflect changes or enhancements.

**Step 11: Seek Continuous Improvement**

Gather criticism from clients and partners to distinguish regions for development. Over time, make use of data and feedback to make your documentation more useful and effective.

## How detailed should process documentation be?

When creating process documentation, one important consideration is determining the appropriate level of detail to include. Too little detail and the documents will lack the information users need to execute processes properly. Too much detail can make the documentation tedious to create and read. Here are some tips for striking the right balance:

* **Identify the purpose** - Consider who will use the documentation and what questions they should be able to answer from reading it. This shapes the detail required. Onboarding new hires may require more specifics than experienced employees.

* **Focus on critical steps** - Include granular detail for steps that are complex, have exceptions, or are critical for quality and compliance. Glaze over repetitive or straightforward tasks.

* **Summarize supporting steps** - For lengthy processes, call out supporting tasks but don't delve into step-by-step minutiae. Provide overview before diving into the procedure.

* **Omit obvious information** - Leave out details that most readers would find intuitive or unnecessary. However, err on side of too much detail with complex processes.

* **Use supplemental materials** - Move ancillary information like background context or technical specifications to appendices or separate documents.

* **Leverage visual aids** - Diagrams, flowcharts, screenshots and models can simplify complex details so you can keep main task descriptions concise.

* **Standardize templates** - Utilize standard templates for consistency across processes, but allow some flexibility in detail level based on process variability.

* **Enable customization** - Build in ability to drill down into more detail through links, attachments or layered documents for those who want more information.

* **Pilot test** - Have sample users provide feedback on level of detail. Add or remove detail according to input on what would be most helpful.

* **Update periodically** - Review documentation regularly to modify detail as processes and user needs evolve.

Following these guidelines will help optimize process documentation with the right level of detail for the target audience.

## When should processes be documented?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UF4T8tB2jdd8w7z1iqQeBJac4duHKg-viXnmTGvrwTSo1_hxZEKktGZCGhxDnfQHjATQ5pYWK99RCA1DBI3BVUuZ0LR89dLaDXCgYi8yJAO7dpyI3dJ1pwylm43cG0kdxpt34lfpqsEa6kcpXsXTgpM)

Determining the right time to document a business process is crucial. Trying to retroactively document processes that have been in place for years can be challenging and result in inaccurate representations. Here are some guidelines on optimal timing for process documentation:

* **Document as processes are designed** - The best practice is to document processes in real time as they are created and tested, before full scale implementation. This ensures documentation stays valid.

* **Document for new processes** - Whenever introducing new processes due to growth, mergers, acquisitions or other change, prioritize creating documentation in parallel during the design phase. Don't wait until after rollout.

* **Document when problems arise** - Issues or bottlenecks often indicate lack of clear documentation. Use these opportunities to illuminate processes.

* **Document for new hires** - Onboarding new employees for existing processes is a key driver for documentation. This promotes knowledge transfer.

* **Document changes and updates** - When processes change due to technology, systems or policy updates, renew documentation right away to stay current. Don't let documentation languish out of date.

* **Set periodic review reminders** - Establish regular reviews of documentation to detect when processes shift from the docs. Update accordingly. Annual reviews are recommended.

* **Document unwritten rules and tribal knowledge** - Capture unofficial workarounds, shortcuts and tribal knowledge that haven't been standardized into official processes yet.

* **Document before employee turnover** - Try to document critical processes before losing the employee responsible to avoid knowledge drain.

* **Interview employees** - Have knowledgeable employees narrate steps for documentation, as they often highlight helpful nuances.

* **Document early in projects** - For long, complex projects, document processes at the start for clarity on resource needs, hand-offs, risks.

Planning documentation proactively during process design and change enables accurately reflecting reality. Keeping documentation evergreen should be built into ongoing business practices.

## Who should be involved in creating process documentation?

Developing comprehensive, useful process documentation requires input from multiple roles. Here are key stakeholders to involve:

* **Process owners** - Directly engage managers of the process to document their expertise. They best understand intricacies and nuances.

* **Frontline employees**  - Include team members that regularly perform the work. They provide real-world perspective on how the process operates.

* **Cross-functional partners** - Consult with other departments that hand-off or interact with the process to illuminate interconnections.

* **Subject matter experts** - Technical specialists like IT professionals or engineers may need to clarify complex specifications or protocols involved.

* **New hires** - Get input from recently onboarded employees on what more they would have wanted to know about the process through docs.

* **Leadership** - Executives often request or fund documentation projects. Their goals for the outcome should inform the work.

* **External stakeholders** - For processes involving customers, vendors or other outside parties, include their insights on interactions.

* **Quality assurance** - These professionals can advise on risks, control points and compliance requirements to document.

* **Training managers** - Those responsible for training new hires need documentation that supports their programs.

* **Project managers** - For processes central to certain projects, project managers can clarify roles, resources and hand-offs.

* **Human resources** - HR can explain talent requirements, job duties and qualifications in detail in descriptions.

* **Employees in other locations** - Account for any differences in processes for global organizations or remote employees.

With input from this diverse group of stakeholders, process documentation benefits from thoroughly capturing both the technical ""how"" and the practical realities of bringing the process to life in the organization. This leads to increased quality and adoption.

## How can process documentation help improve efficiency and quality?

* **Onboarding efficiency** - New hires get up to speed faster with clear, detailed documentation instead of informal training.

* **Risk reduction** - Identifying process failure points, risks, and controls in docs allows organizations to proactively mitigate and monitor for those issues.

* **Compliance**- Documentation ensures processes align with internal policies and external regulations. This facilitates audits.

* **Change management** - During process changes, documentation helps train employees on modifications and new expectations.

* **Resource optimization** - Mapping out processes helps identify redundant efforts to streamline or areas for automation to reduce manual labor.

* **Institutional memory** - Documentation preserves process knowledge even when experienced employees leave, preventing reinvention or knowledge gaps.

* **Problem-solving** - Complete documentation of systems, interactions and sequences helps troubleshoot issues and pain points.

* **Cross-functional alignment** - Clarifying hand-offs between departments improves communication, collaboration and customer experience.

* **Training aid** - Well-documented procedures form the curriculum for new employee onboarding and role-specific training programs.

* **Continuous improvement** - Regularly updating documentation supports analyzing processes for incremental improvements over time.

* **Customer service** - External customer-facing process documents help provide more transparent, timely, and consistent services.

Investing time in thoughtful process documentation pays dividends through enhanced efficiency, quality, and business performance over the long term.

## What are some common pitfalls to avoid when creating process documentation?

Process documentation initiatives often fail to achieve the desired benefits due to some key missteps. Here are common pitfalls to be aware of:

* **Inaccurate or outdated details** - This causes confusion and frustration when employees follow incorrect steps. Update docs promptly when processes change.

* **Overly complex language -** Using a lot of jargon or technical terms without clear definitions hinders comprehension for many readers. Simplify language.

* **Lack of visual elements**- Walls of dense text hamper readability and understanding. Incorporate ample visual aids like flowcharts and screenshots.

* **Disorganized structure**- Documents that lack logical sequencing of steps or grouping of related tasks makes following procedures difficult.

* **Not noting exceptions**- Failing to document alternative steps for contingencies like errors or edge cases leaves employees unprepared to handle them.

* **Excess length** - Avoid exhaustive documents that bog down readers with too much granular detail. Prioritize critical steps.

* **Limited accessibility** -Docs that sit in obscure shared folders rather than easily searchable databases lead to lower awareness and utilization.

* **Lack of version control** - Without clear version numbering and change logs, readers don't know they have outdated documentation.

* **Narrow focus** - Process steps don't exist in isolation. Not providing context through process maps or overview of interconnected systems hampers understanding.

* **Not soliciting user feedback** - Drafting docs without input from those who will actually use them often results in missing key details or poor structure.

* **Manual updating** - Processes evolve, so relying on periodic manual refreshes rather than integrating real-time data results in stale docs.

* **Lack of ownership** - Without formally assigning maintenance responsibilities, accuracy and relevance tends to suffer over time.

Avoiding these missteps takes diligence, but results in streamlined, effective documentation that actually improves organizational performance. It is a critical investment in operational excellence.

## How often should process documentation be reviewed and updated?

Process documentation that isn't regularly reviewed and updated loses its value over time as processes change. Here are some best practices for keeping documentation evergreen:

* **Set a recurring annual review for each document** - Annual reviews are a good rule of thumb for most business processes that change moderately over time.

* **Build in reminders tied to system updates** - When major enterprise systems are updated, prompt process owners to validate documentation.

* **Review after major projects or milestones** - Following an ERP implementation or headquarters move, processes likely changed.

* **Assign documentation maintenance in role responsibilities** - Making individuals accountable for review encourages compliance.

* **Establish a change log** - Note any process changes or doc updates for easier and more transparent reviews.

* **Require sign-off for reviews** - Requiring process owners or leadership to sign that reviews were completed provides verification.

* **Interview employees annually**- Check in with teams annually to identify undocumented changes in how work really happens.

* **Survey users of documentation** - Regular quick user surveys can reveal when docs are falling out of sync with reality.

* **Analyze process performance data** - Where metrics indicate changes in process effectiveness, review documentation.

* **Stay abreast of internal and external change** - Evolving regulations, systems, market demands prompt documentation reviews.

* **Convene focus groups** - Bringing together process stakeholders helps surface various perspectives on needed updates.

* **Schedule updates tied to certain volume milestones** - High-volume processes may require reviews more than annually.

* **Automate data inputs where possible** - Automated flows of real-time data into docs keeps certain sections current.

* **Phase reviews across a year** - Reviewing all documentation annually causes a scramble. Space out reviews across quarters.

Following leading practices for regular process documentation review and update is essential to maintaining the accuracy and value these foundational resources provide.

This is where **Standard Operating Procedures** have been helping companies! 

For firms seeking to boost efficiency, improve quality, and scale operations smoothly, implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) is mission-critical. However, while most organizations recognize the importance of SOP documentation, many fail to realize its full benefits. **Why does this disconnect exist?** Two words: **Proper Execution.**

Simply documenting SOPs in a manual or wiki is not enough to transform ways of working. Like an unused gym membership, those procedures won't have an impact just sitting on a shelf. To truly optimize training, compliance, safety, and cross-functional consistency, SOPs must be embedded into employees' daily work in an accessible, interactive way. New hire onboarding into SOPs is insufficient. Ongoing reinforcement and adherence monitoring are essential.

Leveraging purpose-built software takes SOP benefits to the next level. With **centralized access, visual guides, notifications, analytics,** and more, **cloud platforms** make it easy and rewarding for employees to integrate SOPs into their regular routines. But technology alone isn't the panacea. Strategic adoption techniques, from training and feedback to rewards and accountability, drive a cultural shift.

The following article explores leading practices to **create, manage, and maximize enterprise SOP programs.**

By hosting SOPs on [Docsie](https://site.docsie.io/host-share-standard-operating-procedures-with-team), you can share your entire [knowledge portal](https://site.docsie.io/custom-knowledge-portal) through quick deployment, self-hosting, embedding within shared documents, hosting on a private cloud, etc.  

**But what exactly is an SOP? How does it work? **

This blog explores various aspects of SOP: its purpose, features, format, benefits, etc. As a bonus, it also shares valuable information on [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/), a full-fledged document-creation platform for all your business needs.

It's time to **boost productivity, morale,** and **quality** by bringing standard operating procedures to life across your organization.

## What is a SOP (standard operating procedure)?

A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a documented process that outlines how to complete a routine activity or task. SOPs detail the steps required to complete a task or process from start to finish. They provide clear, concise instructions for employees to follow when carrying out important work functions or processes.

*SOPs are essential for managing operations efficiently and consistently in a business. They serve several key functions:*

1. **Ensure consistency** - SOPs provide standardized instructions so that employees perform tasks correctly and with minimal variation. This enhances quality control.

2. **Improve efficiency** - By providing clear guidelines for employees, SOPs can increase productivity and streamline workflows. Employees don't need to figure out how to complete tasks from scratch each time.

3. **Onboarding new employees** - SOPs help train new hires by detailing company procedures. New employees can refer to SOPs when learning their role.

4. **Ensure compliance** - SOPs help companies meet regulatory requirements and industry standards by documenting proper protocols.

5. **Preserve institutional knowledge** - If an employee leaves, SOPs preserve the methods and knowledge so that work can continue uninterrupted.

SOPs should provide straightforward instructions and cover all necessary steps, from beginning to end. They may include checklists, visual aids like screenshots, or tables to organize information. To ensure usefulness, SOPs should be clearly written, readily accessible to employees, and kept up-to-date.

Implementing SOPs requires initial effort, but the benefits are numerous. With SOPs in place, employees have the resources to perform tasks consistently, and businesses streamline cross-functional processes.** In short, **SOPs are a critical component of an efficient, high-quality operation.

## How to Write A User Manual?

### 1. Understand your audience

Find out who are your users before you start writing. What are their problems, needs, and requirements? Optimise the instructions in your manual so that they work for both beginners and experienced product users. Understand their expertise and match your content. 

### 2. Know the objective

Figure out why you are writing the document. Do you wish to talk about your product features? Or help your users navigate issues or know the troubleshooting steps? Define your goal and draft your content accordingly. 

### 3. Know the product

Gather detailed information by talking to developers, product engineers, etc. Know the background of the product and cross-check information to check its accuracy and relevance. Ask insightful questions and place yourself in the shoes of the product users. 

### 4. Use language mindfully

Choose simple words and phrases that everyone can understand. Avoid using passive voice and stay away from using the first person. Discard jargon and technical terms and explain processes, systems and product features in layman's language. 

### 5. Describe processes

Talk about processes in detail and be as descriptive as possible. Follow a technical writing style but do not overload the document with too much information. Make every word count and do not use ambiguous words or sentences that can create confusion. 

### 6. Add relevant sections

Break complex problems into digestible chunks. Include relevant and appropriate sections such as table of contents, introduction, frequently asked questions, further resources, etc. Outline the document or use a simple template so that you do not miss adding any important sections. 

### 7. Put appropriate visuals

Add photos and videos to attract users to go through your instructions. Convey more through pictures and complement them with carefully placed paragraphs of text. 

### 8. Have a logical flow

Start with the what and then go to the how of your product. Explain key terms and phrases associated with the product, highlight its features and then go to the sections of troubleshooting and further resources. 

### 9. Be crisp

Do not beat about the bush. Convey information. You can use bullet points, tables, flowcharts or diagrams for this. Keep your information updated by keeping in touch with the product developers, research team, engineers, etc. 

### 10. Give final touches 

Proofread your documents before hitting publish. Check for typographical errors, language issues, grammatical inconsistencies, etc. Ensure optimal readability by highlighting key information, using legible fonts and placing headings and subheadings to divide the entire content into separate sections.

## How to Structure and Organize A User Manual?

* Creating an **organized structure** and **logical flow** is crucial to making a user manual easy to navigate and follow. The manual should be arranged into distinct sections or chapters relating to major functions, components or procedures. Use clear, descriptive headings and subheadings to divide information into logical blocks.

* Start with an **overview** or **product introduction section** to provide a high-level orientation before diving into specifics. Group related features or tasks together in sections - for example, separate sections for setup, basic operation, troubleshooting, maintenance. Number chapters and section headings sequentially so the manual has a clear, progressive flow.

* Within **each section, arrange information** in order of usage - **simple** or **preliminary steps** first before more advanced tasks. Give clear procedural instructions in numbered step formats. **Chunk text** into short paragraphs for better readability. Use bulleted or numbered lists where suitable to break up dense text.

* Illustrate **sequences** or **workflows visually** with **diagrams, flowcharts** and **step-by-step graphics**. Show interface or component closeups when relevant. Consider a getting started or quick setup guide upfront for impatient users who don't want to read the full manual. Include a table of contents, index page and glossary of terms for easy navigation and lookup. Using a well-organized structure will make any user manual more coherent, intuitive and user-friendly.

## What's the best way to make a user manual easy to follow and understand?

* The most important aspect of any user manual is making the instructions **easy to follow** and **understand**. Use simple, clear language that avoids overly technical jargon or confusing product-specific terminology. Write short, straightforward sentences in active voice.

* Provide **enough detail** and explanation for users to grasp concepts, but **don't over-explain simple actions**. Use a friendly, conversational tone to help users feel comfortable rather than intimidated. Avoid ambiguous phrasing that could be interpreted different ways.

* Use **consistent terms** to refer to interface elements, buttons, and menu items. Include screenshots and diagrams to visually demonstrate usage and reinforce explanations. Illustrate how the product looks at each step rather than relying solely on text descriptions.

* **Format instructions** in numbered step formats with distinct actions per step. Chunk information into short paragraphs for **better readability**. Use bold headings, bullet points, numbered lists, and ample white space to prevent dense blocks of text.

* Provide **guidance** if users need to complete prerequisites before certain tasks. Give tips, shortcuts or recommendations to aid usage. Include **warnings** or **caution notices** before potentially harmful actions.

* Summarize **key takeaways** or **reminders** after lengthy or complex procedures. Allow skimming by structuring the manual with clear hierarchies and navigation. A well-written user manual tailored to the audience's level of knowledge offers the simplest path to mastery.

## What graphics, screenshots or visuals help improve user manuals?

* **Visuals** are invaluable in user manuals to demonstrate product features, illustrate complex processes, and enhance understanding. Screenshots are essential to show users exactly how the product interface looks and reinforce text instructions. Capture screenshots of key stages during procedures to reveal menu options, button clicks, input fields, notifications etc.

* **Annotate screenshots** with callouts, text labels, and arrows to highlight notable areas and guide users' attention. Make sure images are large enough to show detail while optimized for sharpness. Include close-up shots of buttons or settings when referring to them in steps.

* **Diagrams**, such as wireframes and flowcharts, visualize relationships and workflows. Exploded views detail individual components. Infographics creatively represent stats or data. Photos demonstrate equipment setup. Icons graphically indicate warnings, tips, notes, etc. Consider sketch-style illustrations to explain concepts or add visual interest. Charts and tables organize complex information at a glance.

* **Graphics** should be professionally designed for maximum clarity and visual impact. Use consistent iconography and color-coding across images. Relevant, high-quality graphics not only break up dense text but improve comprehension and recall of instructions.

However, **avoid cluttering** the manual with excessive, unrelated or poorly executed visuals. Images supplement text but shouldn't distract from key messaging. Only use **graphics** that are directly supportive of content. Sufficient white space around visuals enhances readability. With an eye-catching yet minimalist approach, crisp graphics make user manuals more engaging and instructive.

## How detailed and comprehensive should a user manual be?

Determining the right level of detail is a balancing act when creating user manuals. Too little information leaves users confused and unable to properly operate the product. But excessive detail can make manuals unwieldy, dull, and hard to use.

![How detailed and comprehensive should a user manual be?](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_eQ5rAzE1YGfpITafO/image5.png)

* Focus on providing the **minimum instructions** needed for users to complete tasks safely and effectively. Give overview explanations for conceptual background, but avoid in-depth theory or technical minutiae unless directly relevant.

* Describe **every step users** must take to configure settings, operate features, and perform maintenance. Don't assume knowledge or skip seemingly obvious steps. But don't repeat straightforward points.

* Find the sweet spot between **comprehensive** and **concise**. Use succinct phrasing and omit extraneous details. Employ consistent terminology for brevity. Provide expanded explanations selectively where needed to clarify complex processes.

* **Supplement text** with visuals to avoid lengthy passages. Summarize key takeaways after lengthy procedures. Include an index, glossary, and table of contents so users can easily reference details.

* Consider segmenting content across multiple manuals for different user types, such as **beginners vs. advanced users**. Or separate general operating instructions from in-depth technical specifications.

* While **manuals** should be complete, too much information can be counterproductive. Target the needs of real users and find balance through iterative drafting, user testing, and feedback rather than attempting to document every facet exhaustively. A tailored approach produces manuals with sufficient yet tightly focused content for true usability.

## How do I ensure consistency across sections and chapters of a user manual?

**Maintaining consistency** in the format, tone, terminology, and style used across a user manual is key for a cohesive user experience. A consistent manual allows users to easily find and absorb information without confusion or distraction.

Use the **same document structure** throughout, with uniform numbering schemes for **chapters, headings, pages, figures, **and** tables**. Keep formatting elements like text styling, indentations, and line spacing consistent.

Use **identical terminology** to refer to interface elements, components, buttons, menu items etc. Never interchange different terms or labels. Maintain a steady tone whether instructive, conversational, or formal.

Keep the **writing style uniform** by using the same sentence structures and avoiding sudden fluctuations between passive and active voice. Use similar phrase lengths and vocabulary levels without abrupt variations.

Apply identical styling for **notes, tips, warnings, notices**, etc. Format instructions in a consistent numbered step pattern. Standardize visuals like icons, screenshots, and diagrams. Cross-reference chapters, sections, figures, tables, and headings with a consistent numbering/naming system. Create and use style guides, templates, or macros to reinforce uniformity.

While **discrete sections** may target distinct functions, the manual should read as a unified document. Consistency evokes professionalism and supports usability by setting clear user expectations. But consistency should not **trump clarity** - format can be broken when absolutely required for better comprehension and learning.

## How should I format the text, fonts, layout in a user manual for readability?

* The formatting of **text, fonts,** and **layout** in a user manual requires careful consideration for optimal readability.

* Aim for a **clean, well-structured layout** using consistent formatting rules. Avoid **dense paragraphs** and **blocks** of text by using line breaks, whitespace, and bullets. Organize content in logical sections using headings and subheadings.

* For **body text**, use a standard professional font like **Arial, Times New Roman,** or **Calibri** with a **10-12 point size**. Avoid fancy script or display fonts reserved for headlines. Use boldface or italics sparingly for emphasis.

* Ensure adequate line spacing and margins so text doesn't feel cramped. Limit line length to **50-60 characters.** Left align text. Make sure fonts and sizes are consistent across **headings, body text, captions, warnings**, etc.

![Adequate line spacing and margins](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_Ssci2T9UyuGFKaR3j/image4.png)

* Use **numbered** or **bulleted lists** to break up instructions into easy-to-follow steps. Tables organize complex data efficiently. Icons and warning labels stand out from body text. Strategic use of font variations adds visual hierarchy.

* Minimize **large blocks** of **capital letters, underlining, and exclamation points** for readability. Use page breaks thoughtfully between major sections. Number pages and include headers and footers.

* **Formatting** should disappear from the user's view by **facilitating seamless reading comprehension**. Alignment, whitespace, and visual flow allow key information to emerge clearly. A clean, well-formatted layout enhances manual usability and instructional value.

## What tone and language should I use when writing a user manual?

* The tone and language used in a user manual must balance professionalism with approachability. Avoiding overly technical jargon while maintaining accuracy helps make instructions clear and accessible. Use simple, straightforward language that focuses on the user's needs. Explain concepts clearly and provide step-by-step guidance using active voice and positive imperatives (""**Press the power button**"").

* Maintain a conversational, welcoming tone. Use ""**you**"" frequently to directly address the reader. Provide tips and guidance as a helpful instructor rather than just issuing commands. Define necessary **terminology, acronyms**, and **model numbers** on first use. Provide a glossary of terms for reference. Use illustrative analogies or metaphors when explaining complex technical concepts.

* Translating **technical specifications** into easily **digestible instructions** requires skill. Omit extraneous details but avoid oversimplifying. Use consistent phrasing and reinforce explanations with visuals.

* Address the reader respectfully. Avoid **patronizing** or **insulting** language. Maintain an inclusive, professional tone regarding age, gender, culture, abilities, etc.

* While inaccurate or ambiguous terminology frustrates users, clear communication empowers. Review phrasing carefully to exclude potential misunderstandings or negative connotations. Seek **feedback** from actual users when possible.

* With the proper **tone** and **language,** a manual feels welcoming rather than intimidating. **Clear explanations** coupled with **style maximize** the **user manual's effectiveness**.

## How can I make sure a user manual covers safety warnings and disclaimers?

* **User manuals** must alert readers to potential safety hazards and proper operation of products to minimize risks. Clearly communicating safety information protects both the user and manufacturer.

* Include safety warnings before any dangerous actions, such as high voltage exposure, moving parts, chemical interaction, high operating temperatures, etc. Use signal words like ""**Warning**"" or ""**Caution**"" to emphasize hazards.

* Explain possible injury or damage from unsafe practices. Provide **concise instructions** for safe operation. List required protective gear or environmental conditions if applicable.

* Use **visual alerts** like warning symbols or icons to draw attention. Bold, uppercase letters in a contrasting color also highlight warnings. Consistent, dedicated formatting for dangers boosts manual scannability.

* Inform users to read **safety sections** fully and provide certification of training where required. Advise regular equipment inspection and maintenance to prevent injuries. Suggest ergonomic best practices for user health, if relevant.

* Specify safety measures for various user groups like **trained professionals vs consumers**. Consider warning translators or pictograms for global audiences. All safety communication should be highly visible, unambiguous and supplemented with visual cues.

* In addition to **safety guidelines**, also indicate proper equipment use to avoid damage and instruct users to read the manual. While excessive disclaimers undermine focus, highlighting dangers demonstrates the creators concern for user well-being. Clear safety communication minimizes liability and enhances professional reputation.

## Should user manuals be printed or made available digitally?

* **User manuals** can be delivered in either printed or digital formats, each with its own pros and cons. Companies should consider users' needs and product complexity when deciding between print and electronic manuals.

* **Printed manuals** allow for easy onboarding and quick reference without devices. They're ideal for installation, operation, and maintenance instructions that require linear step-by-step guidance. Print also avoids battery/screen limitations.

* However, print can be wasteful, costly, and difficult to update. **Electronic manuals** help conserve resources and can be inexpensively distributed online. They're easily searchable and can include multi-media like video tutorials.

* **Digital formats** are convenient for accessing specs, troubleshooting, how-to or reference information non-sequentially on desktop or mobile. But prolonged screen reading causes fatigue. Digital access relies on internet connectivity and power.

* For highly visual manuals, print maximizes image quality and clarity. But electronic manuals enable zooming for detail. Consider **usability** when determining optimal page size, binding, orientation and paper weight.

* If opting for print, also provide a digital version for anytime, anywhere access. Choose user-friendly software formats for electronic distribution, like **responsive HTML. PDFs** maintain formatting but limit searching.

* Ideally, offer both a printed quick start guide along with a comprehensive e-manual. Evaluate **user needs, product type**, and **task types** to determine if print, digital, or both formats are optimal. A dual delivery approach maximizes manuals availability and utility.

## Key Takeaways:

* A good user manual depends on several factors. It should have a **simple language, attention-grabbing visual elements** and a **logical, hierarchical structure**. Companies should only include specific topics and present those concisely so that customers do not get overwhelmed or might not go through the content. 

* Before writing the manual, ideate the **content, formatting and structure**. Use a reliable software platform and document all that you need to convey to your customers. Choose [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/fr/documentation/user_guides/?doc=/publish-documentation-portal/quick-start/#section-header-two-dg702) to publish your documents online and give access to your team members so that they can edit and share their comments on the piece. 

* A **user manual acts** as the first point of contact for your customers. It should contain all the relevant information about the product and key sections on product maintenance and things to avoid. User manuals should cover all aspects of the product's troubleshooting, frequently asked questions, product functionality, etc. 

* **Discard technical jargon** while explaining complex concepts. Use a simple language which is easy to understand. Explain all the relevant concepts related to your product using simple words. Add graphics, workflows and diagrams only when they add to the existing content and explain them in conjunction with the content. 

* Stay away from sharing **dreary theories** about your product. Give helpful, practical details and do not assume that customers know everything. Be crisp, avoid extra and unnecessary information and share only what is essential. Make sure that all chapters of your user manual maintain consistency in terms of tone, style, formatting, terminology, etc.

Broadly classified, there are **three types of APIs**:

### 1. For team members

Sometimes, companies have an internal API and only particular team members have access and can use it. This kind of API generally streamlines the process of data transfer between systems as well as teams. In this case, the company's internal developers remain in charge of the document. 

### 2. For counterparts

Companies that provide the API, share this outside the organisation where they give access to a second party. In such cases, there exists a business relationship between the two companies. The security measures in these kinds of APIs are relatively stringent. Only authorised clients can gain access to view, maintain and suggest changes. 

### 3. For end users

These are open APIs, so any developer is free to use them. There are no authorisation measures or strict authentication involved herein. Most of the time, these APIs are available for free since the providers want more and more adoption. But sometimes, these come with a subscription fee. This cost, however, depends on how many API calls are made. 

## What are API Documentation Tools?

## Who writes API documentation?

Sometimes, developers who create the APIs take up the task of documentation. However, such documents can become too technical. Therefore, companies hire professional technical writers to work on the documentation. 

Technical writers can understand complex language. And they can also write engaging content while conveying relevant information. API writers must understand the source code and derive sufficient information for **interactive API documentation.**

An API writer typically has the perfect blend of language and programming skills. Good knowledge of programming languages, understanding of formatting standards, excellent communication skills, and knowledge of editorial tools - these are some of the chief qualifications an API writer should have. 

The ideal candidate is someone who knows about programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, etc., and also has some experience and expertise in the domain of technical writing. Individuals with in-depth knowledge of Software Development Kit (SDK) can also do this kind of writing.

## Pros of Custom Knowledge Bases

![Pros of Custom Knowledge Bases](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_HDbtgKoeQBYobiims/image5.jpg)

### 1. Customization

The hallmark of custom knowledge bases is their unparalleled flexibility. You have the freedom to shape them precisely to your needs. For instance, if you're an e-commerce giant, you can design a knowledge base that adapts to your ever-changing product catalog, creating a seamless experience for your customers. For example, [Amazon's customized knowledge base](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wisdom/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKnowledgeBase.html) constantly evolves to keep pace with its vast array of products and services.

### 2. Scalability

Businesses grow, and so do their knowledge requirements. Unsurprisingly, a custom knowledge base can save businesses an average of[ $10,000 per year](https://www.proprofskb.com/blog/much-money-can-knowledge-base-save-business/). Custom solutions scale effortlessly with your organization, ensuring that your knowledge base keeps up with your expansion. For example, A startup can start with a basic custom knowledge base software and scale it as it grows into a multinational corporation.

### 3. Data Control

With a custom knowledge base, you hold the reins to your data. This unrestricted access allows you to manage, update, and secure your information as you see fit. For example, Healthcare providers can ensure the utmost privacy of patient data within their custom knowledge base.

### 4. Enhanced Customer Experience

[Studies ](https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/07/real-time-response-to-customers.html)have shown that 82% of customers expect immediate access to information. Custom knowledge base software allows you to provide real-time, relevant content, which leads to improved user satisfaction. For example, [Airbnb's custom knowledge base ](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2575)ensures travelers quickly find the perfect accommodations.

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems

Custom knowledge bases are not siloed systems. Instead, they work in harmony with your current programs and infrastructure. As a result, you can give your customers a uniform and unified experience across all media. Knowledge bases can be hooked up to other systems, like banking software so that customers always have the latest info. This could make customers happier and less annoyed.  

### 6. In-Depth Analyses

Custom knowledge bases do more than merely store facts and figures. Better business decisions may be made with the data they gather and evaluate. By monitoring their consumers' actions and preferences, stores may better target their advertising. 

### 7. Security

Companies lose billions of dollars annually due to security breaches in their data. For the protection of private data, custom solution providers offer a greater level of security. Custom knowledge bases, for instance, are used by government organizations to protect sensitive information. Custom knowledge bases can be adapted to the specific sorts of data that need to be safeguarded and are created to match the organization's unique demands. 

### 8. Help with Complicated Processes

Workflows are as unique as the companies that use them. Custom knowledge base software may be made to fit your organization's unique needs for efficiency. Custom knowledge bases can be used by manufacturing organizations to improve their production processes, for instance.

### 9. Brand Management and Visual Direction

The quality of your body of information represents your company. Customization allows you to maintain brand integrity and design consistency for your user base. [Apple's support documentation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) greatly illustrates its attention to detail and ease of use.

### 10. Super-Specific Information

Relevance is paramount in the modern digital era. Thanks to custom knowledge bases, you may serve up highly targeted material that caters to the individual needs of various user groups. Customized information for kids, teachers, and school officials is one example.

## Cons of Custom Knowledge Bases

![Cons of Custom Knowledge Bases](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_6Y9oQq6GIdfGGnBES/image4.jpg)


### 1. Development Time

Building a custom knowledge base takes time and effort. It's not going to happen in a day. In order to find a solution that works for you, you must first identify what those needs are. It may take many months, for instance, to create a specialized knowledge base for a healthcare professional.

### 2. High Cost

Customization comes at a high price. It might be expensive to create and manage your own database of information. For instance, a tailored solution may be out of reach financially for a small organization.

### 3. Maintenance Challenges

Custom solutions, in contrast to pre-packaged software, require regular upkeep to ensure they are always up to date and safe. By way of illustration, tech firms' custom knowledge bases need constant updates to fend off new dangers.

### 4. Learning Curve

Employees may need some time to adjust to a new, bespoke system. The pace of integration may be slowed as a result. For instance, new users may need training when they go from pre-packaged software to a tailored solution.

### 5. Resource Intensive

Custom solution implementations need a commitment of time, effort, and technical know-how. Companies in the manufacturing sector, for instance, require qualified personnel to oversee their exclusive knowledge base.

### 6. Risk of Over-Complication

In the pursuit of customization, there's a risk of making the system overly complex, which can lead to inefficiency. For example, Complex custom knowledge bases confuse users rather than help them.

### 7. Initial Setup Complexity

Setting up a custom knowledge base can be tough, especially if you've never done it before. Startups, for example, might have trouble with the initial documentation and setup of a custom solution.

### 8. Vendor Dependence

Custom solutions often entail dependence on specific vendors for development and support. For example, Enterprises may rely heavily on a software development company for their custom knowledge base.

### 9. Lack of Immediate Solutions

Unlike ready-to-use software that provides instant solutions, custom development takes time to implement, delaying immediate benefits. For example, A retail business might not see immediate improvements after starting the custom knowledge base development process.

### 10. Incompatibility Issues

Custom solutions can sometimes clash with other software in your organization, which can cause problems. For example, it can be tricky to integrate a custom knowledge base with legacy systems.

## The Importance of Customer Service in Retail

Customer service in retail is not a mere support functionâ€”it's a pivotal force in shaping relationships, nurturing loyalty, and fostering repeat business.

[86% ](https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/)of customers say that customer service is the most important factor in their decision to choose a retail brand.[ ](https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/) 

A bad customer experience is cited as the cause for [67% ](https://www.slideshare.net/ekolsky/cx-for-executives/2)of customers switching businesses. 

Around[ 90%](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/01/customer-first-insights-home.html) of consumers across the globe rate dispute resolution as their top customer service priority.

Here's why exceptional customer service is a strategic imperative:

![Why exceptional customer service is a strategic imperative](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_R8ChkYD3TwZi0QTio/image5.png)

**Relationship building: **Customer service transcends transactions, becoming a powerful catalyst in forging enduring connections with patrons. It's the personalized touch that transforms one-time buyers into devoted brand advocates.

**Loyalty cultivation:** In the dynamic world of retail where choices abound, exceptional customer service is the key to cultivating unwavering loyalty. It goes beyond meeting immediate needs, laying the groundwork for sustained allegiance to a brand.

**Driving repeat business:** Beyond facilitating purchases, outstanding customer service propels the wheel of repeat business. It makes clients feel like more than simply customers by providing an experience tailored to their own wants and requirements.

**Personalized experiences: **Businesses that put an emphasis on and provide outstanding customer service will stand out in a crowded industry. A company's reputation greatly benefits from satisfied customers who spread the word about their excellent service. 

**Brand advocacy:** Customers who have received excellent service are far more likely to spread the word about your company. When people talk positively about a product or service based on their own personal experiences, it becomes an effective marketing technique. 

In a nutshell, customer service in retail is the practice of making each and every client's experience positive and stress-free. In today's competitive retail environment, standing out requires going above and beyond the transactional to build a relationship that lasts.

10/11/2023 9:45:32,Tanya A Mishra,"According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-12-13-gartner-predictions-for-cmos-show-ai-social-toxicity-and-data-privacy-forge-the-future-of-marketing), 75% of midsize companies and large enterprises by 2024 will employ AI to generate marketing materials. AI documentation is creating ripples in the market today for simplifying the laborious data entry processes while maintaining high quality and accuracy. In this article, we will discuss three key areas of AI-based documentation - multilingual capability, customizable knowledge scopes, and user feedback adaptation. As a bonus, we will also shed light on [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/) and how it can help you fulfil all your documentation needs. 

### Role of AI in Modern Documentation 

AI can be a great collaborative partner for content creators. From generating short videos to creating imagesâ€”the technology is increasing efficiency, saving time, and easing the content creation process. 

As AI documentation is coming into the picture, businesses and individual content creators are analysing their target audience and crafting customised content within the minimum time. With paperless documentation being the need of the hour, companies are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning for document creation, management, and safe accessibility. 

AI-integrated tools such as [Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/) are leading this transformative journey from time-consuming document processing systems to more cost-effective content creation, creating high value. However, no technology is set in stone. Today's AI-powered tools should understand the needs of the users and continue to upgrade the technology and the systems following genuine feedback from the users. 

![](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_GSqjaOm83atQybsIu/image3.png)

## Multilingual Capabilities in AI Documentation 

The language that dominates the internet today is English. However, multilingualism in the case of global content involves a communication challenge. 

Starting with technical bottlenecks, there are other vulnerabilities, including the safety of the users who use a non-dominant language online and access, usage, and continuous production of localised content. 

But with built-in multilingual capability, AI processes and tools can unlock the key to this problem. Today, AI is changing the landscape of multilingual search by understanding the meaning, relevance, appropriateness, and context of the words used. AI-powered multilanguage content is opening newer markets for businesses while machine-generated translations are becoming culturally more appropriate and accurate. 

When it comes to AI documentation, translation, and localization, some of the reputed global software companies have cracked the code! 

While Google Translate is perhaps the best example of AI-powered translation, we have also seen Facebook making its platform accessible by translating all content into local languages. 

On one hand, we have Netflix, the global video streaming platform, translating its subtitles and voiceovers into multiple languages, and on the other hand, there is Airbnb translating listing descriptions and displaying rental reviews in the searchers' preferred languages. 

## Customizable Knowledge Scopes

Have you ever felt overwhelmed with information overload? Don't worry, we all have been in that place as internet users. Customizable knowledge scopes in AI documentation mitigate this issue as they help users personalise the information they want to receive. This helps users to tailor content based on their needs and preferences, leading to better interaction with the AI systems and an improved user experience. 

Content creators can tailor their access to specific information by following simple measures. They can select preferred topics or categories, enter specific keywords, and use advanced search filters to retrieve only relevant and appropriate information for themselves. The AI systems constantly study user behaviours, monitor user interactions, and provide content recommendations accordingly. 

Today's customers love receiving personalised content. Therefore, with knowledge scopes, users can access information quickly without encountering huge chunks of unrelated and irrelevant data buckets. [Docsie](https://app.docsie.io/login/#/) is a one-of-a-kind AI-powered documentation tool that offers customization flexibility, decreasing information overload and improving adoption and user satisfaction. With [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/), you can write documents that appeal to your customers, retain them as your clients, and create a positive image of your brand in the market.

## Adapting to User Feedback 

No matter how much machines may progress, it is human imagination and creativity that drive the show and make a content piece stand out. Through AI documentation, you can, no doubt, create specific content pieces within the minimum time by sharing the context and a handful of prompts. But to make the content strike the hearts of your audience, you need human intervention. This is where user feedback becomes important. 

The giant tech companies are investing in **building AI systems** that can learn from the users, take up their suggestions, understand their preferences, and continuously improve based on user inputs. Here, AI behaves as a student who pays attention to user interaction with the AI-generated content and gathers feedback. 

There are several examples where AI has been adaptive to user feedback. The first example that comes to our mind is the content recommendations by YouTube or the OTT platforms. Apart from that, we also have our social media feeds and e-commerce recommendations that are continuously refreshed based on our watch time, browsing history, purchasing patterns, etc. 

## Future Possibilities 

Whether it is healthcare or retail, education or manufacturing's documentation plays an important role in keeping things organised and reaching out to the target audience. In the AI-powered future, documentation is a highly thriving area where we can create, edit, manage, and share large chunks of text within the minimum time. 

From streamlining the documentation process to creating more personalised user-based stories, an AI which learns from users** **can make the content creation procedure more fun, efficient, and accessible. 

In the next couple of decades, AI-generated content will disrupt the documentation sector and create highly immersive and interactive content for users. The combination of AI and augmented reality will usher in an era of intelligent and seamless content production, keeping the humaneness intact and the spark of creativity alive. 

Tools like [Docsie](https://help.docsie.io/) will continue to evolve in terms of adaptive learning, natural language understanding, knowledge sharing, etc., and we will be able to create and curate content integrating our feedback.

## Overcoming Challenges and Concerns 

Among the common concerns associated with AI, the ones that assume the topmost priority are accuracy and reliability. AI systems can, at times, provide inaccurate documentation and also potentially misuse the privacy of user data. Today, people use AI to generate fake content, misleading news, etc. Therefore, there is a big question mark related to how AI can be used in compliance with legal and regulatory issues. 

However, the industries using AI document organizers are aware of these challenges and are taking up strategies to overcome them. This includes improving the data quality, adopting fairness and transparency in AI use, fusing the strengths of human inputs and AI and constantly training the users on the abilities and limitations of such systems. Continual research and plugging in user feedback can also strengthen AI tools and make them more reliable, user-friendly, and in line with regulatory standards.

![How is product documentation so hard](https://cdn.docsie.io/workspace_PfNzfGj3YfKKtTO4T/doc_QiqgSuNoJpspcExF3/file_MUVXKzN8Ysle6Ng5I/image1.png)

In the business world, which is always changing, having complete and up-to-date product paperwork is essential for success. However, let's be honest: keeping good paperwork can be hard, but it can **leverage** the business. From the difficulties of API instructions to the tricky nature of delivering to multiple clients and overcoming **documentation challenges**, here are some of the most common issues that businesses have:

**1. Maintaining API product documentation**: It can be hard to keep API docs updated when things change so often.

These days, APIs are what make software work. However, updating their instructions with software that changes quickly can be hard. Docsie steps in to make this process go smoothly and quickly.

**2. Maintenance and permissions during product documentation**:  It takes too long to update and get document permissions.

Delays in getting updates to documentation accepted can make it harder to develop new products and help customers. Docsie speeds up the review process so that work can get done.

**3. Release Workflow:** There isn't a clear way to create new or updated product documents.

Docsie gives you a clear, organized way to release new paperwork, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

**4. Multi-Client Delivery**: The job of ensuring that documents are sent to the right people worldwide.

Customized paperwork is often needed for global clients. Docsie makes it easy to change material to fit the needs of different groups of people.

**5. White Labeling Needs for Knowledge Management**: It's hard to brand documentation sites for certain clients.

Branding your documents for different clients can be hard, but Docsie has white-labelling options that simplify the process.

**6. Customer dissatisfaction** The effect of bad documentation is more help calls and customer confusion because of bad documentation.

Customers get angry, more help calls happen, and misunderstandings happen when there isn't enough documentation. Docsie gives you the tools to make complete, clear guides.

**7. Direct Source Updates**: The need to change API docs from the source code by hand.

Docsie automatically changes the source code, so your API documentation stays up to date with little work from you.

**8. Alternatives to Documentation:** What are the cons of standard documentation versus in-app help?

Docsie is more than just documents; it also has in-app help for a more interactive and immersive **document management** experience.

**9. Lack of an LLM robot:** There isn't a chatbot for fixing problems in real-time.

The **Docsie LLM** chatbot can quickly help users fix product documentation problems, reducing user frustration and support calls.

**10. Product documentation problems with localization**: Has trouble translating and adapting documents for use in different countries.

Docsie makes translating and localizing documents easier for foreign markets so that more people can access them.

**11. [SOPs](https://www.docsie.io/blog/articles/creating-effective-sop-guidelines-examples-templates/)**, Compliance, and Audits:** It can be hard to keep SOPs and job tools up to date and ready for daily employee tasks, as well as to ensure that everyone follows the rules and is ready for internal and external audits.

Docsie helps you keep Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and job aids up to date and ensures they are always followed. This makes internal and external checks easier.

10/25/2023 9:54:34,Tanya A Mishra,"Launching your product in the market takes immense effort, not only from your end but from your team's end as well. They have to go back and forth, collaborate with different stakeholders, take care of all requirements, and improve interdepartmental collaboration. Product managers, back-end & front-end developers, and other tech team members sit together to brainstorm before launching any new releases. Going through this process means preparing multiple docs. How hectic is that for your team?

In times like these, having a platform that offers content customization, flexibility, and knowledge management features becomes a necessity. You get the shield you need while planning, tracking, communicating, and evaluating your project. 

## Why is there a need for customization in documentation?

Every project has its magnitude and importance. The size, complexity, scope, and risks related to a project decide how you need to adjust customization in documentation. Maintaining a knowledge base and adjusting a project's requirements with content customization tools play a pivotal role in helping you save time, avoid confusion, and align your team better. 

But how will you know if you need a customization tool for better project flow? Do you need to go through a certain set of procedures? Well, read on the next section to understand how to assess your need for project documentation. 

## How to assess project documentation needs?

The golden rule of business is to not hop onto anything without measuring the pros and cons of your decision. But let's keep the need for content customization away from this golden rule. 

To assess the need for project customization tools, you must consider the objectives, requirements, and expectations of your project documentation from different angles. To get clarity, you must ask questions relating to:

The scope of project documentation

Audiences and users

Uses of the product

Product-related standards and guidelines

Asking these questions will give you a clear picture on what platform to choose and what features to look for when planning to implement documentation tools. 

## How to identify the best match for a content customization tool?

In the last report published by [M-File on Intelligent Information Management](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/), they found that having an inefficient content customization tool can lead to workflow challenges. 65% of respondents in that survey mentioned they face challenges in reviewing, approving, and signing documents in the absence of a proper tool for knowledge base and content customization. 

It makes finding the right tool even more necessary. But how will you find that perfect match? Here are a few points to consider when looking for tools offering customization in documentation. 

### Identify a suitable mode of operation

Enterprise documentation has two modes: an on-site enterprise document management system and a cloud-based document management system. On-site DMS allows companies to access data from their own server but to use this tool, you must be present in the office's campus. However, cloud-based DMS tools offer greater flexibility to the remote workforce as they can get access to the data from anywhere. 

### Consider the cost factor

Cost is a deciding factor here. If you are going for an on-site DMS, expect to shell out large upfront costs to make team collaboration easier. However, if you are planning for a cloud-based system, you can expect the entire setup to be done in half the cost of on-site DMS. 

### Look for data security

Data security is a no-brainer. Your documents must be hacked-proof without even asking for it. In the case of on-site DMS, you have more control over security while the ownership of security lies on the shoulders of your service provider in the case of cloud-based DMS. 

### Option for backing up files

In the case of on-site DMS, the data files need to be backed up frequently as there is no automatic backup option. Therefore, the chances of data loss are higher. In the cloud-based system, the backup happens on its own. So you don't have to worry about data loss in case of unfortunate events. 

## 5 features to look for in documentation software

Creating a collaborative team space becomes easy when you have the right tools with you. Here is a list of features that you must look for when selecting the right documentation tools for your organisation. 

### 1. Document Sharing

When working with multiple stakeholders, you have to keep everyone on the same page. One of the ways to keep everyone involved in a project is by taking their opinions and making changes to the product in accordance with the valuable inputs received. A documentation content management platform should give the flexibility of sharing data in-house with clients and stakeholders. 

### 2. Security

Security should be the top priority when selecting documentation software suitable for your organization. Your preferred choice should have the latest security tools and software to ensure that only authorized people have access to data. 

### 3. Editing options

Finding the right document should not be a struggle for your team. 83% of employees lose their precious time[ recreating documents that already exist](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/). Therefore, the DMS should have the option of showing the updated version of the document first. Moreover, people with editing access to the doc must be able to make changes to it directly. 

### 4. Document classification

Document classification and labeling errors make it difficult for employees to find the right document on time. A good DMS must have the feature to create metadata automatically for docs once they are prepared by the team. This will free the team from the responsibility of creating names for the files, thus reducing manual errors and saving time. 

### 5. Keyword Search

The right documentation software should give the flexibility to the team to search for relevant documents using keywords. It should display relevant results on the screen to facilitate quicker doc search. 

Having these five incredible features in a documentation tool offers platform flexibility and helps your team save time in finding and editing the right documents. These features also help your organization enhance its planning, collaboration, evaluation, and knowledge management while handling different projects. 

## Making the right choice with Docsie

From advertising to entertainment, education to human resourcesâ€”various industries are making the most of prompt engineering to elicit the most appropriate responses from the language models. While writing on various content-heavy topics, technical writers have a tough time making their articles relatable and digestible. In this article, we will discuss how you can use AI in technical documentation. As a bonus, you will also get a sneak peek of technical writing with Docsie!

## What is Prompt Engineering?

|Prompt Engineering at A Glance|
|-|The definition|
|At its core, prompt engineering refers to the art (and science!) of developing and crafting prompts which we can use to receive our desired outputs from language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. While some of us might have good questioning skills up our sleeves, technical writers need to know the ins and outs of prompt engineering so that they can create better commands, ask more insightful questions and give better instructions to AI systems. |
|The principles|
|Currently, the use of AI in the technical documentation creation process is going through a series of developments. However, we should understand that all prompt creation depends on two chief principles - clarity and specificity. We can receive our desired responses from the language-trained AI models only when our prompts are well-engineered, specific and have zero ambiguity.|
|The purpose|
|The benefits of prompt engineering are limitless as it involves text-to-text as well as text-to-image and text-to-sound models. Prompt engineers and technical writers create AI prompts, analyse the outputs and further refine them, abiding by the compliance and regulatory issues as well as catering to the needs of social contexts.|
 

## What are the benefits of Prompt Engineering?

When it comes to using AI in technical documentation, tools like[ ](https://www.docsie.io/collaboration_software/)[Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/collaboration_software/) can be your ultimate saviour. However, knowing the basics of prompt engineering also helps technical writers share information with a user-focused approach containing less jargon.

 

As the language models for technical writers continue to grow and develop consistently, artificial intelligence will play a significant role in crafting human-friendly, easy-to-understand prompts.

 

Here are the top benefits of prompt engineering:

 

â—              It enhances user experience, reduces ambiguity and confusion and delivers quick resolutions independently.

â—              It fine-tunes the prompts, optimises them and brings down user frustration.

â—              When writers master prompt engineering, they are better able to leverage its power. From streamlining business operations to powering virtual assistants, writers can explore limitless options.

â—              Maintaining a consistent style, tone and voice really gets easy and it saves time and resources for organisations and agencies.

â—              Through AI translations, effective prompts can be translated to suit varying cultural contexts and global audiences.

## How can Technical Writers Excel in Prompt Engineering?

AI is an ever-expanding space. So, to keep up with the growing demands of using AI in technical documentation, writers need to understand how to guide the systems to get relevant content. Before diving into technical writing with Docsie, technical writers should know how to create the perfect prompts for AI systems.

 

To explore the multiple benefits of prompt engineering, writers should develop technical skills or brush up on their existing ones so that they can create a wide variety of technical documents.

 

Here are 10 tips on how to become an expert in prompt engineering and explore the world of technical writing with AI:

Whether you are a marketer or a content creator, we all know how important it is to know the query of our target audience. Understanding the needs of your end customers is the key to crafting effective prompts. Gathering knowledge on several factors such as age, gender, location, preferences, etc., can help you to create a user persona. And based on this persona of the ideal user, you can customise and refine your prompts.

### 2. Personalisation and context

A Large Language Model needs to know the context of your prompt. So, by entering a little bit of background knowledge into the system, you can train the LLM to give you the desired output. When creating technical writing with Docsie, the platform lets you deploy LLM chatbots for immediate and assured assistance and query resolutions. For example, you can ask the AI system to explain how magnets work by adding the context that it needs to be appropriate for 6th-grade students.

### 3. Knowing the art of brevity

Learning the benefits of prompt engineering is as important as understanding how to convey information concisely through your content pieces. Address the topic at hand and write to the point content so that readers can gain a clear message from your words. Break down complex technical information and write in a relatable, user-friendly tone. Keep in mind that you are writing for humans. So, keep your readers engaged and write in a language they can understand easily.

### 4. Knowledge of machine learning

When you are working as a technical writer for a company or an agency, knowing a thing or two about machine learning can help you a great deal and put you much ahead of your competitors. With machine learning, you can analyse the user behaviour data of the past and then make changes to your prompts based on that. You can create finer prompts for a better user experience and enhance the quality of the output.

### 5. Illustrate with examples

References and analogies work best where definitions fail. So, cite examples and use similies and analogies in your articles to make it easier for the broader audience (without technical knowledge) to understand. When you are exploring technical writing with Docsie, write in the everyday language and convey your message with simplicity and authenticity.

### 6. A unique writing style

As you continue to integrate AI in technical documentation, sometimes your technical content might become dry and too stiff to read. With a unique writing style, you can craft better prompts and eventually make your content more engaging and comprehensive for a wide range of audiences. Avoid using highly technical words and phrases and use layman's terms to reach a broader audience who might not know the technical terminology.

### 7. Technical expertise

If you wish to reap the fullest benefits of prompt engineering, try and gain a strong hold on the common programming languages. While coding experience is not mandatory, gathering information about the most used programming languages will help you customise your interactions with different AI models. You will be able to give finer prompts, automate repetitive, mundane tasks and implement security measures.

### 8. Structure your prompt

All effective prompts have one thing in common. They have a good flow with an introduction, detailed sections and a proper outro. Suppose you need to give a prompt to your AI system to craft a job description for a vacancy. The intro will consist of the role introduction and the responsibilities, the body will contain instructions on what kind of tone is required along with guidelines on the length of sentences and the final outro will summarise the main task in a few words.

### 9. Research

Dig deeper into technical concepts and broaden the horizon of your knowledge by reading articles, manuals and getting to know industry-specific terminology. So, to fully unleash the benefits of prompt engineering, you need to research deeper, understand technical concepts and then break them down into smaller, digestible chunks for your users to read and understand.

### 10. Stay updated

In your journey of technical writing with Docsie, the platform will undoubtedly give you all the tools to create detailed documentation - all under the same roof. But you need to stay updated on the recent industry happenings, read technical news and attend industry events to find inside stories and get content for your next article.

11/6/2023 10:17:39,Tanya A Mishra,"Have you ever spent hours editing the wrong document version? I can feel your pain. 

Documenting your content should be an easy process without any goof-ups. However, at times we face issues managing the documentation workflow. It not only kills your time but also hampers the collaboration in your team. You can repeal these mistakes by implementing documentation version control and change tracking. 

Today, global businesses operate from different corners of the world. Their workforce is distributed globally so the importance of team collaboration has multiplied manifold. Therefore, managing documents has become more important than ever to maintain efficiency and a steady workflow. Following documentation best practices can help you move a step closer to bringing more accuracy in the workplace. 

With agile development, many companies are creating documentation software to enhance inter-team collaboration and help the organization move toward better efficiency. In this blog, we will help you understand the A to Z of documentation management and version control. So dig in to know everything about the basics of change tracking. 

## What is Version Control?

Version control gives you complete authority over a document. If a common document is being shared among multiple shareholders with editing rights, you can track the recent changes. It also allows you to recall specific versions according to your needs. It enhances documentation hygiene by making you follow documentation best practices. 

## Why is Version Control Needed in Documentation?

Version control in documentation helps you avoid confusion and saves time by giving you access to the latest version of the document. It improves team collaboration by improving the scope of communication among team members. As you have transparency on the doc version, you can easily track the changes made by each team member. This feature is especially beneficial for product managers, writers, and engineers working on the same product updates. Moreover, the collaboration tools give you an upper hand in identifying and resolving conflicts quickly. 

Documentation tools like [Docsie come with team collaboration](https://site.docsie.io/documentation-collaboration-software) and project management functionality. You can manage your documents on the go with these kinds of collaboration tools. The centralized platform helps you create embeddable software documents that adapt according to the preferences, languages, and locations of your customers.

## Benefits of Document Sharing

Imagine yourself to be a product manager working closely with content writers. You and your team are trying to market the right features and make your customers understand your new offerings. Your team and the writers are using the same document to list down the features but the document does not have the option to check version history. In the absence of this feature, you and the writers may work on different versions of the same document. Think of how much time and effort you will lose in such a scenario. 

Having documentation management software and following documentation best practices can help you avoid such problems. Here are a few benefits of using collaboration tools like Docsie.  

### Accurate and reliable information

Data integrity is the top priority for organizations all over the world. Every organization wants the information that is passed among departments to be accurate and up-to-date. Therefore, the feature of viewing document history becomes important as it allows stakeholders to make changes and update everyone with relevant information. It also secures the everyday documentation process. Through change tracking, you can control accidental edits, improve accuracy, and ensure the reliability of the documents. 

### Low chances of error

In a recent [report published by M-Files](https://www.m-files.com/infographic-18-startling-information-management-statistics-3/), it was concluded that 46% of respondents mentioned that it is time-consuming and challenging to findthe documents they need. Without document history tracking, you may make edits on the wrong documents and circulate the same in your organization. This may put your company at risk. Having collaboration tools that allow you to edit the latest version when document sharing reduces the chances of errors. It controls the chances of errors during content creation and brings every stakeholder on the same page before they want to send the document out to the public. Moreover, these tools help you follow the documentation best practices correctly. 

### Tracking history

Change tracking in the documents is necessary when managing multiple versions of the documents. Using document history, you can see who is contributing what to the projects. Moreover, when the documents are shared with the internal and external teams, you can see the changes made by writers, product managers, third-party contractors, and other stakeholders. It reduces errors and gives you control to make the necessary changes without any disruption. 

### Document access control

History tracking during document sharing also improves safety standards. It ensures that the workflow processes comply with the safety instructions followed in your specific industry of operation. As the risk of cybersecurity threats has increased, protecting sensitive information is a prerequisite for organizations across the globe. Using documents with version control can help organizations uptight their security by adding user authentication, password encryption, and access control. 

### Better workflows

History tracking in documents helps in improving the workflows, therefore adding more to organizational efficiency and productivity. It makes it easier for different talent pools to collaborate and contribute to the same project. They can make inputs, review changes, and merge conflicts and confusions.

## What is Testing Documentation?

Software testing is an everyday affair in the lives of product designers, testers and software engineers. Testing documentation refers to creating documents related to software testing. Such documents are produced when software products are developed and maintained. Technical writers write these documents using the best practices for testing documentation to record plans and progress of different phases of software testing.

When it comes to testing process optimisation, test documentation helps teams create a comprehensive plan for software designing, test implementation and record keeping.

When you maintain a testing document, you can write down the details of all your software testing plans, including the product owners and the team members. It helps you create the testing environment so that other teams or employees can reuse the information and use it as a reference for future cases.

If we look into the different examples of testing documentation, we can observe that these detailed reports share more insights about the testing processes. They also play an important role in keeping all the stakeholders updated about the testing progress. Documentation also enables testers to analyse the efficiency of the testing procedures which helps them to further optimise the testing practices.

Several testing documentation platforms help users create documents related to the various testing phases. If you are looking for such a platform, use [Docsie](https://www.docsie.io/pricing/) as your trusted software partner and create documents in an easy, fun way!

## Types of Testing Documentation

In today's world where we use software products for almost everything, creating quality assurance documentation is highly important. With proper documentation partners like [Docsie](https://app.docsie.io/login/#/), software companies can keep their stakeholders updated regarding the progress of their projects and help the end users understand the suitability of the product concerned.

### Test strategy:

A high-level document, describes the testing technique, the tested module and multiple components, including test processes, test objectives, documentation formats, customer communications strategy, etc.

### Test plan:

Generally prepared by the manager or test lead, this planning document has multiple components such as scope, risks, approaches, resources, defect tracking, assumption, etc.

## Test case documentation:

A descriptive document outlines the testing steps and includes detailed information regarding the preferred outcome and the actual test results.

### Test scenario:

This provides insights into the different test scenarios of the application. It does not include the navigation steps or the input data but helps engineers understand the application's gradual flow.

### Test data:

Technical writers generally create this document before test execution begins. Prepared in Excel manually, this document records data that is used when testing cases are implemented.

### Bug report:

This records the defects in the software system and also provides solutions for how to debug the product. It is the go-to content for all sorts of issues - open, solved or work in progress.

### Test policy:

Every software company follows certain principles and methods as its testing guidelines. This document sheds light on those and how they align with the overall testing goals of the company.

### Test summary:

## What are the best practices for Testing Documentation?

Merely drafting the content is not enough. Your end users should understand your documentation and have some key takeaways from the process. By following the  best practices for testing documentation, you can create a customer-facing document and enhance the overall user experience.

Areas

Importance

Regularly updated

Whatever is not regularly updated is bound to lose its relevance and importance. Software products are dynamic. Keeping in line with that, make changes to your testing documentation so that it reflects the most recent alterations in the testing phases.

Version control

Adhere to a system that helps you monitor the changes made to your documentation. Implement the version control feature to understand who has edited your documentation and when.

Use a single source

Create and store your documentation in a single place so that your team members can easily access and use it. Use a single knowledge base as the source of truth to remove unnecessary time spent searching for the right information.

Protect sensitive information

This is perhaps one of the most important software development best practices that include keeping your documentation private and allowing only a bunch of people to access and make changes to it. Ensure high levels of security and take extra care so that no unwanted teams or members can access valuable information about your product.

Train team members

Provide complete training to your team members so that everyone understands the content and usage of your documentation process. Team up with the QA department and involve them in the documentation creation project.

Maintain a style guide

Create and stick to a style guide to ensure tone consistency in the documentation process. When you follow a standardised set of guidelines, you can set the tone and frame a coherent tone for the entire length of your documents.

Have standardised templates

Use content templates to present your documentation professionally. From adding visuals to including examples and exercises, have a set format so that all your documents look consistent in their structure and format.
