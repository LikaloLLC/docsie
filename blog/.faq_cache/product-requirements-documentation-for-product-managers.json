      "question": "What are the essential components that should be included in a Product Requirements Document (PRD)?",
      "answer": "A comprehensive PRD should include the product's intended purpose and use case, realistic goals and objectives, detailed feature descriptions, virtual product design mockups, and system/environment requirements. Using Docsie's documentation platform, product managers can easily organize these components with rich formatting, tables, and visual elements to create clear, professional PRDs that stakeholders can access securely."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Docsie help product managers create and manage PRDs more efficiently?",
      "answer": "Docsie provides robust tools including an intuitive editor with styling options, easy image and table insertion, password protection for secure stakeholder access, and interactive web publishing capabilities. The platform streamlines the entire PRD creation process from initial drafting to final publication, allowing product managers to focus on content rather than formatting and distribution logistics."

    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a Business Requirements Document (BRD)?",
      "answer": "A PRD focuses on specific product features, functionality, and user experience from the customer's perspective, while a BRD concentrates on business objectives and preventing resource waste on non-essential elements. PRDs are typically created by product managers to guide development teams, whereas BRDs are often prepared by business analysts or executives to align projects with business goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can teams securely share PRDs with stakeholders using Docsie?",
      "answer": "Docsie offers password protection features that allow teams to secure their PRD documentation before sharing with stakeholders. Teams can publish their PRDs on Docsie's interactive web portal or embed them on their own sites, then control access through password authentication to ensure sensitive product information remains confidential during the review process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Docsie's documentation platform particularly suitable for creating technical product documentation like PRDs?",

The platform's workspace organization, version control, and collaborative features make it ideal for product managers who need to create, iterate, and maintain complex technical documentation while ensuring stakeholder accessibility and security."
