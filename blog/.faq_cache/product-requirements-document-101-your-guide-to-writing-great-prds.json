      "question": "What makes a Product Requirements Document different from other project documentation?",
      "answer": "A PRD serves as a detailed blueprint of all product characteristics, features, and capabilities that guides the entire development process. Unlike other documents, it's specifically designed to help product teams understand the seller's vision, target customers, and problem-solving approach. It acts as the foundational document that informs all subsequent documentation in the software release process."

      "answer": "Every effective PRD should include the product's goal and background, detailed feature characteristics with use cases, system requirements for end-user environments, and assumptions/obstacles for implementation. Additionally, it should outline project deadlines, success metrics, release criteria, and clearly define what's in scope versus out of scope. These components ensure all stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of the product vision."

    {
