      "question": "How does Docsie help prevent security breaches in product documentation compared to traditional methods like email?",
      "answer": "Docsie provides password-protected collaboration environments that are far safer than emailing sensitive information. Unlike emails which can be easily breached, Docsie offers secure cloud-based documentation with role-based access controls, digital timestamps tracking all changes, and the ability to set users as Admin, Editor, or Viewer with specific permissions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role-based security features does Docsie offer for managing team access to sensitive product documentation?",
      "answer": "Docsie allows workspace owners to assign specific roles including 'Owners' (full control), 'Admins' (can create books and shelves), 'Editors' (can edit existing content), and 'Viewers' (read-only access). This granular permission system ensures only authorized personnel can access or modify sensitive product documentation, reducing the risk of unauthorized data exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I track who made changes to my product documentation and when for security audit purposes?",
      "answer": "Yes, Docsie automatically tracks all document interactions through digital timestamps that record who edited documentation, what revisions were made, and when changes occurred. This audit trail is easily accessible by clicking the circular clock icon in any book, providing complete visibility for security monitoring and compliance purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I password protect my product documentation in Docsie to secure patent-pending information?",
      "answer": "You can password protect documentation by clicking the three dots next to your shelf or book, selecting 'Properties,' then 'More options' to access the password dashboard. You can protect entire shelves (all books within) or individual books, and only users with the password will be able to access the protected content."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Docsie more secure than using PDF files for collaborative product documentation?",
      "answer": "While PDFs offer basic password protection, they're impractical for documentation that needs frequent updates and collaboration. Docsie provides dynamic security with real-time collaboration, role-based permissions, change tracking, and secure cloud storage, making it far more suitable for teams working on evolving product documentation that requires both security and productivity."
