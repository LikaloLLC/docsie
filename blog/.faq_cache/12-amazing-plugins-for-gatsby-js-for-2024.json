      "question": "What makes Docsie's Gatsby plugin different from other documentation solutions like gatsby-theme-docz?",
      "answer": "Unlike gatsby-theme-docz which requires writing documentation in MDX files, Docsie's gatsby-plugin-docsie automatically imports content from your existing Docsie workspaces. This eliminates the need to maintain separate documentation files and provides seamless integration with Docsie's collaborative documentation platform, offering both auto-generated pages and custom GraphQL queries for complete control."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the gatsby-plugin-docsie help solve common documentation maintenance challenges?",
      "answer": "The gatsby-plugin-docsie addresses documentation maintenance by centralizing all content in Docsie's platform and automatically syncing it to your Gatsby site. This eliminates the need to manage separate Markdown files, reduces documentation drift, and allows teams to collaborate on documentation using Docsie's enterprise features while maintaining the performance benefits of a Gatsby static site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize the styling and layout when using gatsby-plugin-docsie for my documentation site?",
      "answer": "Yes, gatsby-plugin-docsie provides extensive customization options. You can style the auto-generated pages using predefined CSS classes like .docsie-main-container and .docsie-nav-container, or disable auto-generation entirely and use GraphQL queries (DociseDoc, DociseBook, DocsieArticle, DocsieNav) to build completely custom React components and layouts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the performance benefits of using Docsie with Gatsby compared to traditional documentation platforms?",
      "answer": "Combining Docsie with Gatsby delivers the best of both worlds: Docsie's collaborative documentation management with Gatsby's blazing-fast static site generation. Your documentation loads instantly with pre-rendered HTML, benefits from Gatsby's image optimization and offline capabilities, while still maintaining real-time content updates from your Docsie workspace."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with gatsby-plugin-docsie and what configuration options are available?",
      "answer": "Install gatsby-source-docsie and configure it in gatsby-config.js with your deployment ID, optional path prefix, target language, and whether to auto-generate pages. The plugin offers flexible options including automatic page generation for quick setup or manual GraphQL queries for developers who need complete control over page creation and styling."
