      "question": "What makes a product one-pager different from other product documentation, and how can Docsie help create effective ones?",
      "answer": "A product one-pager is a concise, well-researched document that bridges the gap between idea conception and full project blueprints, focusing on building stakeholder support rather than detailed specifications. Docsie enables you to create stylish, professional one-pagers that can be easily shared via email, converted to PDF format, and password-protected to ensure confidential project information stays secure."
    },
    {
