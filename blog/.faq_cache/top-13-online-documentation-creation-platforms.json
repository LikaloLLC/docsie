      "question": "What collaboration features should I look for in a documentation platform?",
      "answer": "Key collaboration features include real-time editing, commenting systems, task assignment, user roles and permissions, and version control with change tracking.

    {
      "question": "How do I choose between internal vs external documentation platforms?",
      "answer": "Consider platforms that support both use cases for flexibility - Docsie excels here with secure pages using JWT verification for internal docs and public portals for external documentation. Confluence is great for internal project documentation, while platforms like GitBook focus more on external open-source documentation, making Docsie ideal for businesses needing both capabilities."
