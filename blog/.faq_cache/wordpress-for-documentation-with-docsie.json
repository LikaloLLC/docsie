      "question": "How does Docsie's WordPress integration simplify documentation publishing compared to traditional methods?",
      "answer": "Docsie streamlines WordPress publishing through a single deployment script that can be generated from within the platform. Users simply select their content, choose display options through a graphical interface, and paste the generated code into WordPress - no complex coding required. This codeless approach supports rapid publishing for both small and large documentation libraries."

    {
      "question": "Can Docsie handle multiple product versions and languages for global WordPress sites?",
      "answer": "Yes, Docsie excels at managing complex documentation needs through its versioning system and built-in machine translation feature. You can maintain multiple document versions for different product releases while automatically translating content into various languages. This is crucial since 75% of consumers prefer purchasing products with information in their local language."

      "question": "How does Docsie's organizational structure of workspaces, shelves, and books benefit large documentation projects?",
      "answer": "Docsie's hierarchical structure allows unlimited scalability - you can create multiple 'books' (documents) organized on 'shelves' (product categories) within workspaces. This system makes it easy to manage extensive documentation libraries while maintaining clear organization. The structure also supports custom branding that propagates across all documents automatically."
