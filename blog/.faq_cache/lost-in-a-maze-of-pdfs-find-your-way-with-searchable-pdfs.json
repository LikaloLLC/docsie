      "question": "How much time can searchable PDFs actually save for knowledge workers?",
      "answer": "According to McKinsey Global Institute research, knowledge workers spend approximately 1.8 weeks per year searching for and retrieving information.

      "question": "Can I try Docsie's searchable PDF features before committing to a paid plan?",
      "answer": "Yes, Docsie offers a free trial that allows you to test their automated searchable PDF functionality and see how it transforms your document management processes. This lets you experience the benefits in real-time before making a decision."

      "question": "What should I do if my existing PDFs are image-based or scanned documents?",
      "answer": "For image-based PDFs, you'll need OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to convert them into searchable format. While you can use standalone OCR tools like Adobe Acrobat Pro or online converters, Docsie handles this conversion automatically when you upload documents to their platform."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I maximize the searchability of my PDFs beyond just making them text-searchable?",
      "answer": "Use descriptive file names (like 'Marketing_Campaign_Performance_Report_October_2023.pdf'), employ proper formatting with headings and bullet points, and consider adding bookmarks for lengthy documents. These practices improve both findability and navigation, especially when combined with Docsie's advanced search capabilities."
