      "question": "What's the main difference between product documentation and software documentation?",
      "answer": "Product documentation is user-facing content that explains how to use a product's features and interface, written for non-technical audiences. Software documentation covers the technical aspects like architecture, APIs, installation, and configuration for developers and IT administrators."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we create product documentation or software documentation first?",
      "answer": "Start with software documentation first, as it serves as the foundation and single-source-of-truth. This technical foundation helps product documentation writers better understand the system to create clearer, more accurate user-facing content."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can product and software documentation teams work together effectively?",
      "answer": "Software teams provide technical expertise and detailed system knowledge, while product teams contribute user experience insights and plain-language communication skills. Collaboration ensures technical accuracy while maintaining user-friendly content that serves both audiences effectively."

    {
      "question": "How does Docsie help manage both product and software documentation?",
      "answer": "Docsie provides a unified platform where both product and software documentation teams can collaborate seamlessly. With features like documentation portals and version management, teams can maintain technical accuracy while delivering user-friendly content from a single source of truth."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should product documentation be updated compared to software documentation?",
      "answer": "Software documentation requires frequent updates with each code commit, new features, or dependency changes. Product documentation only needs updates when software changes affect user workflows or interface elements, making it less frequent but equally important for user experience."
