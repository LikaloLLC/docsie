      "question": "What types of product documentation should I prioritize for a successful product launch?",
      "answer": "Focus on four key types: Product Requirements Documentation (PRDs) for internal alignment, user guides for self-service support, setup/installation guides for technical implementation, and marketing assets that clearly communicate your product's value proposition. These documents should work together to support both internal teams and end users throughout the launch process."

    {
      "question": "What's the best way to make technical product documentation accessible to different user skill levels?",
      "answer": "Use the KISS principle and aim for a Flesch-Kincaid readability score equivalent to grade 8 (ages 13-14) to maximize comprehension. Combine clear, jargon-free writing with visual elements like screenshots, videos, and GIFs to accommodate different learning styles, and always provide simplified definitions when technical terms are necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should I organize and structure product documentation to improve user experience?",
      "answer": "Store all documentation in a central, searchable location with clear formatting using headings, bullet points, and numbered lists. Link to related topics when mentioned, categorize content by user intent (learning, goals, understanding, or information), and ensure your platform supports global search functionality so users can quickly find what they need."
    },
    {
      "question": "What features should I look for in a documentation platform for product launches?",
