      "question": "Why is documentation so critical for product managers specifically?",
      "answer": "Documentation serves as a repository for all significant decisions and helps retain product information across teams. It ensures accountability, facilitates knowledge transfer during personnel changes, and enables effective communication between cross-functional teams. Without proper documentation, product managers spend time putting out fires instead of focusing on strategic work."

    {
      "question": "What are the essential components of a Product Requirements Document (PRD)?",
      "answer": "A comprehensive PRD should include six critical elements: Objective (client problem and alignment with company vision), Release (scope and timeline), Features (detailed specifications), User flow and design (wireframes and mockups), Analytics (success metrics and hypotheses), and Future work (roadmap considerations). These components ensure the entire product team works toward a common goal."

      "question": "What's the difference between simply listing features and writing proper user stories?",
      "answer": "Simply listing features ignores the context of the consumer and creates discrepancies between your vision and the delivery team's understanding. Proper user stories provide context about client requirements and real-life usage examples based on user research. Well-written user stories eliminate the possibility of teams building the wrong thing and save significant time during execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does written communication improve team accountability and project momentum?",
      "answer": "Written documentation holds everyone accountable by making expectations and responsibilities publicly visible to all team members. It prevents product managers from hoarding information and reduces time spent on explanations or fire-fighting. When teams have continuous access to comprehensive product information, projects move faster because everyone can work independently with clear guidelines and deadlines."
