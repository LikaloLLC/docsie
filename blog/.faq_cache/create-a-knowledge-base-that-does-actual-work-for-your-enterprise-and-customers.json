      "question": "What's the difference between an employee knowledge base and a customer knowledge base?",
      "answer": "An employee knowledge base is internal and consolidates enterprise knowledge like employee handbooks, HR policies, and best practices to help employees do their jobs seamlessly. A customer knowledge base is external and contains self-service content like how-to articles, FAQs, and tutorials to help customers resolve issues independently. Docsie allows you to create both types or combine them with user permissions to control access to different content sections."
    },
