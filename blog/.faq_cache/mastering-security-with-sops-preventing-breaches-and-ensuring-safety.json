      "question": "What specific security SOP categories can organizations create and manage using Docsie?",
      "answer": "Organizations can create comprehensive security SOPs across five critical areas: Physical Access Control (ID badges, visitor protocols), Cybersecurity (password policies, incident response), Emergency Response (evacuation, disaster recovery), Information Security & Data Protection (data classification, secure disposal), and Employee Onboarding/Offboarding (access management, device retrieval). Docsie's platform supports multimedia integration and visual aids to make these complex procedures easily understandable."
