      "question": "What makes Docsie a better alternative to GitBook for documentation teams?",
      "answer": "Docsie offers several advantages over GitBook, including robust collaboration features with real-time commenting and task assignment, AI-powered translation capabilities, comprehensive version control with timestamping, and advanced analytics to track user engagement. Unlike GitBook's limitations in categorization and content management, Docsie provides unlimited versions and translations with fine-grained permission controls."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Docsie's pricing compare to other GitBook alternatives?",
      "answer": "Docsie offers competitive pricing with five tiers starting from a free Startup plan, then Startup Plus at $39/month, Small Teams at $79/month, Business at $249/month, and Organization at $699/month. This pricing structure is often more cost-effective than alternatives like ProProf's per-page pricing model or KnowledgeOwl's higher-tier plans starting at $79/month."
    },
    {
      "question": "What collaboration features does Docsie provide that GitBook lacks?",
      "answer": "Docsie excels in collaboration with features GitBook is missing, including real-time collaborative editing, comment boards for team feedback, task assignment capabilities, and comprehensive user roles and permissions. All changes are timestamped for complete audit trails, and teams can work together seamlessly on documentation projects with full version control."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Docsie handle both internal documentation and customer-facing knowledge bases?",
      "answer": "Yes, Docsie is designed for both internal and external documentation needs. It can serve as an internal wiki for teams while also creating customer-facing knowledge bases and product documentation. Docsie portals can be hosted natively or self-hosted using Docsie Script, with customizable branding to match your company's look and feel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What translation capabilities does Docsie offer compared to other documentation platforms?",
      "answer": "Docsie stands out with its AI-powered ghost translator that enables practically unlimited translations with high accuracy at the click of a button. This automated translation feature is more advanced than many alternatives that either lack translation capabilities entirely or require manual translation processes, making Docsie ideal for global teams and international product documentation."
