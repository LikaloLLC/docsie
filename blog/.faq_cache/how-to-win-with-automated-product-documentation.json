This object-driven approach makes it easy for teams to understand and navigate documentation structure, while providing tools to move items with key automations. It's designed like 'Github for documentation' - creating a familiar, universally adoptable context for information management."

This versatility means your content becomes truly portable, enabling you to move seamlessly from drafts to production across multiple platforms rather than being locked into a single publishing destination."
