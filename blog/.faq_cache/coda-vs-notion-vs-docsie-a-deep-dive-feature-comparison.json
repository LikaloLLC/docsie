      "question": "What makes Docsie different from Notion and Coda for documentation needs?",
      "answer": "Docsie is specifically designed for knowledge management with an intuitive library-like structure using shelves, books, and sections. Unlike Notion and Coda's block-based approach, Docsie offers a WordPress-style editor that's more user-friendly for documentation. It excels with powerful version control, 19 content embeds, password-protected sharing, and specialized features for creating SOPs, wikis, and product documentation."

    {
      "question": "How does Docsie's pricing compare to Notion and Coda for small teams?",
      "answer": "Docsie offers the most affordable solution for knowledge management with flat-fee pricing plans based on team size. While Notion charges $4-8/month per user and Coda charges $10-30/month per user, Docsie's plans are designed for collaborative teams up to 15 editors at competitive rates. Docsie also provides a free plan for up to 3 users with unlimited guest access."

    {
      "question": "Can Docsie handle version control better than Notion and Coda?",
      "answer": "Yes, Docsie has the most robust version control among the three platforms. While Coda offers minimal version control and Notion only provides rollbacks on enterprise plans, Docsie maintains all previous article versions within each book. You can designate current versions, control what readers see, and manage access permissions for different versions."

      "question": "What content embedding capabilities does Docsie offer that Notion and Coda don't?",

This allows you to edit embedded content directly within your knowledge portal without switching tabs or apps. This embedded approach is more comprehensive than Notion and Coda's integration methods."
